Abstract.  In the ever-evolving landscape of medical research and healthcare, the 
abundance of scientific articles presents both a treasure trove of knowledge and a 
daunting challenge. Researchers, clinicians, and data scientists grapple with vast 
amounts of unstructured information, seeking to extract meaningful insights that can drive advancements in the biomedical domain including, research trends, patient 
care, drug discovery, and disease understanding. This paper utilizes the topic 
extraction algorithms on Breast Cancer Research to shed light on the current trends and the path to follow in this field. We utilized TextRank and Large Language 
Models (LLM) using the TripleA tool to extract topics in the field, analyzing and 
comparing the results.  
Keywords.  Topic Extraction, Natural Language Processing, Large Language 
Models, Text Rank, Breast Cancer, Bibliometric Analysis 
1. Introduction 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subf ield of AI that provides algorithms for text 
analysis. Large language models (LLMs) are AI models trained on vast text data using 
NLP methods. Combining NLP and LLMs enables effective analysis of unstructured text 
like scientific articles. This integrated approa ch identifies key medical concepts and 
extracts actionable insights. NLP and LLMs t ogether transform raw text into valuable 
knowledge for healthcare and research [1–3]. 
This paper explores advanced topic ex traction from scientific articles. It builds on 
our previous work developing a tool for acce ssing, storing, and analyzing papers using a 
graph/network approach [4].  The focus is on navigating the complexities of medical 
research, aiming to identify relationships b etween symptoms, medications, and diseases. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights to healthcare professionals.

doi:10.3233/SHTI240566944Topic extraction is a popular NLP task that has received extens ive research interest. 
A machine-learning technique that organizes and understands large text data collections. 
It automatically assigns topics or themes as "tags" or categor ies to individual texts [5]. 
Topic extraction is also known as topic analysis or  topic detection. Its uses include 
document clustering, trend analysis,  bibliometric analysis, and more. 
There are several approach es for topic extraction, including probabilistic models, 
meta-heuristic algorithms, n- gram based methods, and uns upervised techniques. Some 
examples are LDA, MVO, Text Rank, TopicRank, PositionRank, and Large Language 
Models (LLMs) [6–12]. This paper utilize d TextRank and LLMs as topic extraction 
methods. A comparison of the results from these two methods is provided. 
2. Methods 
We have used TextRank and LLM to extrac t topics. We extracted paper abstracts using 
PubMed API as provided by the “Triple A”.  The complete source code, results and 
documentations are available at GitHub2. To extract topics we have taken the following 
eight steps: 
1. Initial Configuration : Initial configurations and ma chine setup actions, such 
as setting environment variables, wer e performed in this step. 
2. Article Abstract Extraction : To retrieve relevant papers with minimum 
quality content, we used th e search strategy keywords: ("Breast Cancer"[Title]) 
AND (Therapy[Title]). 
3. Article Metadata Preparation : In this step, "Triple A" operators were used to 
process paper metadata and content at  different states, including extracting 
keywords and MeSH terms from the metadata. 
4. Extract Topic Using TextRank : Analyzed the title and abstract of the articles 
using TextRank Algorithm based on the to p 10 keyword ranks per each paper, 
i.e. top 10 highest ranked words were selected as main topics. 
5. Extract Topic Using LLM : The titles and abstracts were analyzed using an 
LLM based on the top 10 identified to pics. The open-source Mistral model3 
[13], was used for topic identification,  with a template specifying parameters 
like temperature, penalties, and token limits.  
6. Export Dataset : Exported the cleaned data to be publicly available at figshare 
[14] for further research, making the process and analyses reusable. 
7. Co-occurrence Graph Construction : The extracted topics and keywords were 
used to construct three co-occurrenc e graphs, which were exported as graphml 
files for further analysis. 
8. Visualization : VOSviewer [15] was used to  visualize the cleaned co-
occurrence graphs. Some nodes were disc arded as they forc ed bias towards 
obvious breast cancer-related keywords/terms, suppressing visualization of 
other nodes like "patient," "tre atment," "breast cancer," etc.

This paper proposes a pipeline to extract relevant topics in the breast cancer domain. 
9,691 paper abstracts were extracted. Seven steps were followed to perform topic extraction using different approaches, resultin g in graphs of various topics related to 
symptoms, treatments, procedures, etc. Comp aring the large keyword/term/topic co-
occurrence graphs from unstructured bi omedical literature is challenging. However, 
network metrics facilitated by networkx[16] enable analysis and comparison of these co-
occurrence networks, as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 describes the complete and raw co -occurrence graphs. However, only 
excerpts of the graphs with  highest degree nodes were vi sualized in Figures 1 to 3, 
discarding biased obvious nodes due to the limitations of the processing platform.

According to Table 1, a comparison of th e performance of Te xtRank and LLM for 
topic extraction shows that LLM was capable of extracti ng more topics with more 
relations leading to a higher average degree and higher clustering coefficient which 
means that the nodes tend to have  more relations and they tend to have existent neighbors, 
respectively. For the l atter expression, a high  clustering coefficient suggests that there is 
a community structure, where nodes within a community have strong ties. This is shown 
by the number of components, as well. Comp aring these networks to the keyword co-
occurrence network indicates that although the keywords network has a higher average 
degree, it has a lower clustering coefficient ten ding to have fewer components. This may 
be due to using more specific keywords by  the authors as the metadata of the papers to 
make them accessible. 
4. Discussion 
Extracting meaningful information from scientific articles presents  several challenges, 
especially for the advanced task of topic extraction. These challenges include [17]: 
/g120 Lack of domain-specific labeled data for accurate topic modeling. 
/g120 Key insights buried in lengthy bac kground, experimental details and citations. 
/g120 Linguistic diversity for the same conc epts requiring ro bust NLP techniques. 
/g120 Variations in writing styles and languages from diverse author backgrounds. 
/g120 Context-dependent scientific terms with multiple meanings requiring 
disambiguating based on context. 
To overcome these issues as mu ch as possible, providing a reproducible pipeline for 
information extraction, one can utilize sever al tools and packages. In this regard, we 
developed and upgraded TripleA [4] to analy ze scientific papers. Being equipped with 
Graph Structure and processing capabilit ies, makes this tool a great potential for 
information extraction, as well. On the othe r hand, we selected TextRank and LLM 
primarily due to their robustness to noisy input, making them suitable for real-world 
scenarios. The graph- based nature of TextRank allows for transparent interpretation of 
results. These algorithms do not require domain -specific training, making them widely 
applicable and they handle large documen ts efficiently without sacrificing quality. 
5. Conclusions 
In this paper, we developed a pipeline based on Tr iple A, to extract topics from scientific 
papers. We tested this pipeline in the Breast Cancer field. We extracted 9,691 papers and 
E. Bitaraf et al. / Unveiling Medical Insights: Advanced Topic Extraction 947analyzed the topics using TextRank and LL M. An analysis of the co-occurrence 
networks of topics extracted by TextRank, LLM, and articles' keywords, showed that 
LLM extracted more topics that tend to constr uct concept clusters and TextRank stays in 
the second place in comparison to that. An analysis of the degree distribution of these 
networks will reveal a better understanding of  how the topics are connected and how 
such a network behaves. It seems that if Clinical Trial articles are used, the extracted 
topics in treatments and fa ctors affecting the diseas e will form a suitable knowledge 
graph that will be used for clinical decision support systems.
