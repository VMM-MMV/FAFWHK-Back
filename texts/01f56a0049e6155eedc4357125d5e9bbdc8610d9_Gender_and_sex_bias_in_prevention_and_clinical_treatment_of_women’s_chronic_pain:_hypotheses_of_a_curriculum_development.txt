This discursive paper focuses on undergraduate medical education’s role in 
tackling gender bias in clinical practice, specifically preventing and managing 
from a non-biomedical perspective chronic pain in women. A preliminary 
web search of medical schools’ curricula was performed to identify programs 
content related to gender bias in pain management. The web search included 
10 universities’ websites selected from the top  10 rankings QS Universities 
Rankings 2022 for medical schools. Additionally, a questionnaire was sent to all 
deans of the selected academic institutions to explore the curriculum content 
further. The web search, and the lack of response from the deans, highlighted 
that relevant curriculum components on gender bias and chronic pain needed 
to be  implemented. Therefore, this paper introduces an innovative curriculum 
development approach designed by the multi-professional research team to 
be  implemented in medical school programs. This novel educational strategy 
could also cross-contaminate other healthcare practitioners’ university programs 
and, thus, stimulate an interprofessional debate into fostering inclusiveness and 
equal opportunities in health.

1. Introduction
Medical education has been concerned with providing predominantly undergraduate 
students with the knowledge of the biophysical determinant of illnesses of the human body ( 1). 
With this discursive paper, an interprofessional team of academics and researchers from 
anthropology, nursing, education, medical science, and public health aimed to design a 
curriculum development intervention for medical education on psychosocial aspects of health, 
specifically chronic pain and gender.
Western medicine is transitioning from a clinical and biological model to a new one 
developed around the more exhaustive definition of health as per the WHO definition that says 
“...a state of complete well-being, mental and not the mere absence of the state of disease 
or infirmity. ”
The so-called patient-centered medicine aims ( 2, 3) at placing the person at the center 
of care and at defining disease  not only as a mere organic/physiological dysfunction of the 
organism (disease) but as a complex phenomenon experienced, both individually (illness) OPEN ACCESS

Frontiers in Medicine 02 frontiersin.organd socially (sickness) ( 4, 5). Nevertheless, Western medicine 
remains firmly rooted in biological determinism and the need to 
rely on data and evidence to offer answers using the most advanced 
technology. This biological determinism not only shapes medical 
and operational practices in healthcare settings but also strongly 
characterizes curricula and university programs attended by 
healthcare students and professionals. The limits of an exclusively 
“technical” approach with scant attention to the person emerge 
clearly when biomedicine is confronted with chronic pain, 
especially when the patient is female. Chronic pain is an enigma 
for evidence-based medicine because it is invisible. It cannot 
be  traced objectively and visually in the organism, it cannot 
be examined by the “medical gaze” ( 6), and thus it escapes from 
empirical supervision. However, on the other hand, pain is also an 
experience ( 7): it is not a mere physiological sensation but, instead, 
is the result of an elaboration process of this sensation, where 
emotional, cognitive, individual, social, cultural, and 
environmental factors play a central role. In this sense, pain takes 
shape in the peculiarity of individual biographies, also manifesting 
itself as a “total” ( 8), having a multidimensional impact and 
affecting several aspects of life (psychic, social, relational, etc.). 
Therefore, pain management should be based on a holistic and 
personalized care approach. This approach contributes to defining 
pain  as a multidimensional experience shaped by several elements. 
Among these elements are sex and gender differences that 
influence health and disease, particularly the processes of pain 
chronicization ( 9–12).
Chronic pain primarily affects the female population ( 13–16). 
However, most studies investigating pain mechanisms are mainly 
conducted on the male population ( 17–20), while physiological 
mechanisms underlying women’s pain and gender/sex differences 
are yet to be explored in-depth. The same is true for pharmacology 
(21, 22): most drugs are tested on the 70-kilo ideal male type, and 
the recommended dosages refer to this standard, even if women 
and men have different abilities to metabolize the active 
ingredients ( 23).
In literature, and especially in gender medicine studies, it has been 
repeatedly highlighted how doctors’ scant consideration and 
preparation for women’s health and female patients’ pain may 
be  responsible for gender bias1 in care settings ( 23–27). Gender 
stereotypes influence biomedical ways of analyzing, interpreting, and 
treating female pain. For instance, several studies have shown that 
female pain is often underestimated since health professionals tend to 
frame it as a phenomenon amplified by behavioral and attitudinal 
traits that are considered to be “typically” females–such as amplified 
emotionality, psychological vulnerability and dramatization–which 
would lead them to less tolerate pain and manifest it exaggeratedly ( 24, 
28–30). This leads professionals to be more inclined to interpret the 
symptoms reported by the male population as organic and those 
1 By gender bias, we mean the bias generated by stereotypes, i.e., distortions, 
which occur when gender differences have not been adequately considered. 
The stereotype (from the Greek “stereos” and “typos,” i.e., “rigid image”) is 
equivalent to the representation shared by a social group regarding another 
social group to which characteristics are attributed that derive from approximate 
generalizations.reported by the female population as psychosomatic, underestimating 
them ( 31, 32). The invisibility of pain and the difficulty in identifying 
a specific pathology that causes chronic pain also lead to the 
stigmatization of women suffering from complex chronic pain 
syndromes, as is well shown in the literature ( 29, 30, 33–35). Many 
women with chronic pain report that they were not believed and that 
their pain was not treated ( 29, 33).
The gender biases within a clinician-person relationship can result 
in a lack of equity and access to care. Literature ( 24, 36) is rich in 
examples of such biases. Compared to men, women receive less 
intensive and effective pain care ( 37–42). Women are less likely to 
be prescribed analgesics and opiates ( 37, 43) and more likely to receive 
antidepressant prescriptions than men ( 38). Furthermore, when male 
and female patients express the same type of pain, female patients are 
more likely to be  referred to psychotherapy, while men receive 
pharmacological medications ( 29, 42, 44, 45). Psychologizing women’s 
chronic pain not only leads to an underestimation of a massive health 
problem but also has a negative impact on their illness experience; 
many women, in fact, state that they feel abandoned by health 
professionals, family members or partners, friends, and colleagues 
(29, 46).
Physicians’ gender stereotypes are responsible for inequalities in 
medicine and clinical practice. Research must examine how these 
stereotypes generate care disparities and influence patient–
professional interactions. Therefore, to reduce gender bias, the 
awareness of values and attitudes toward gender must increase within 
the medical society. A possible approach is including gender theory 
and discussions in medical school curricula. However, a growing body 
of literature shows how gender medicine, specifically women’s health, 
is almost neglected in the medical schools’ curricula ( 47, 48). In 
addition, 70% of postgraduate physicians in training indicated that 
gender medicine concepts are never or sporadically discussed in their 
training program ( 49).
Because sex and gender are health determinants, incorporating 
these contents into medical curricula could promote a more 
comprehensive patient-centered approach. Research should focus on 
understanding how basic pain mechanisms may differ in the two sexes 
and the diverse ways in which gender differences currently influence 
diagnostic and treatment decisions. In addition, optimal pain 
management requires that clinicians understand and examine their 
gender stereotypes and be  prepared to evaluate whether these 
stereotypes result in less-than-optimal pain management for specific 
individuals. This paper aims to analyze whether courses centered on 
gender medicine and, in particular, on female pain are provided in 
medical schools’ curricula. The paper aims to design a medical school’s 
curriculum innovation intervention for tackling gender-based health 
inequalities and fostering a biopsychosocial model for preventing and 
treating pain.
2. Method
The project implied several explorative steps allowing the research 
team to reflect on and design a suitable new course aiming at tackling 
gender bias in pain management in medical students.
The first step consisted of browsing the available web content of 
10 worldwide top universities and medical schools ( 50) programs. 
Specifically, the web search sought any humanistic or social sciences Moretti et al. 10.3389/fmed.2023.1189126
Frontiers in Medicine 03 frontiersin.orglectures, training, or awareness courses within the programs 
selected. This first step was necessary as it is highly probable that 
interventions or training proposals aimed at raising pain/gender 
awareness are included in program modules with a humanistic and 
relational focus. In fact, training medical students to orient their 
clinical lenses to observe pain as a complex and gendered 
phenomenon is directly linked with implementing their 
communication, psycho, and social skills ( 51, 52). We directed our 
attention to the manifest content of medical school websites as a 
retrospective process to help us answer our initial question. 
Therefore, we explored 10 of the most important worldwide medical 
schools’ curricula and the available content to uncover to what 
extent medical curricula may contribute to tackling gender-based 
health inequalities and promote a non-biomedical approach to 
managing pain in women.
The second step of the project aimed at collecting more 
information on the university’s websites mentioned above on the 
humanistic contents of their programs. A questionnaire was 
emailed to the Deans for students’ teaching and learning experience 
and heads of departments of each of the 10 involved medical 
schools. The research team designed the three open-ended 
questions to investigate education leaders’ awareness or possibility 
of foreseeing training on the project topic ( Appendix 1 ). Three 
separate reminders were sent to elicit a response and 
maximize participation.
The last step consisted of the course design phase, considering 
the previous steps’ findings. Therefore, the research team designed an 
innovative educational program in medical education that combines 
authors’ different points of view and respective disciplines background.
The study took place under local regulations, and no ethical 
approval was sought from the university ethics committee. 
Therefore, no personal and sensitive data were expected to 
be collected according to the developed questionnaire. Moreover, 
the invited Deans/heads of the Department have yet to respond to 
the questionnaire; thus, only literature review data are presented 
in this article.
3. Results
The research team selected medical schools among the top 10 
universities per several continents (Europe, Asia, America, and 
Canada) according to the Top 10 ranking QS Universities Rankings 
2022 ( Appendix 2 ). The team selected three universities per continent, 
plus one for the United  Kingdom. Each university website was 
searched for downloadable programs and curriculum content. 
Therefore, the search aimed to detect humanities, social science, 
anthropology, psychology, sociology, and similar fields elements 
incorporated in the selected curricula. In addition, any element or 
suggestion about person-centered care, medical humanities, model of 
care, communication, and interprofessional approaches was also 
considered. Universities with these characteristics and access were 
included. Finally, the accessible university programs and curriculum 
were analyzed.
The general perception of the programs analyzed was limited 
space for humanistic content. The number of hours dedicated to these 
lectures is generally minimal compared to the number of hours devoted to formative sciences and clinical skills. However, this final 
material selection brought the team’s attention to several crucial 
aspects. Although supported and preannounced to have a humanistic 
approach to health, some universities only possess some teaching with 
this content in the actual program. For example, one university 
describes its approach to medicine as holistic, but this concept needs 
to be explained or expanded within the program.
However, the same medical school proposed a course in 
psychological medicine in the third year. An interesting aspect is 
represented by an Asian approach for first-year students with a 
module called a journey to understand myself, society, human beings 
and human life . Nevertheless, the contents of this very promising 
module are not accessible, but they give an idea of a more person-
centered model. A North American university teaches the “narrative 
medicine” approach within foundational seminars across all 
the programs.
Interesting to notice that some academic contexts put the study 
of communication, medical humanities, or psychology in the first 
2 years. At the same time, others dedicate seminars on the same 
topics in the second part of their pathway when they are more 
senior. The Canadian model (CANmeds) adopted by two selected 
universities (Europe and Toronto) is worth mentioning. CANmeds 
consists of an integrated model of care developed by and for 
physicians. According to this model, the students approach 
medicine from the first year in an integrated way, combining 
clinical skills with aspects of medicine more concerned with 
relationships and community health.
The response to the second step of our inquiry into medical 
education was very scarce. The educational leaders have yet to 
respond to emails containing the brief questionnaire. Therefore, the 
research team decided to expand the search for references further 
in postgraduate education courses or training in the medical and 
health profession. From this last purposive review, the team found 
specific courses for the medical profession (sometimes open to 
interprofessionality) that are more focused on gender medicine and 
pain management. This last fact highlights that, at this moment, the 
education on topics so sensitive and deep into the human 
experience of illness is relegated to the ones who are probably 
already interested in it or looking for further specialization. Among 
the different courses, Harvard University, with a master’s in public 
health, designed a course in Gender, Women and Health. In 
comparison, the University of Aberdeen has a course on Women’s 
Health in a Global Setting, open to all health professions.
4. Discussion
The findings from this last search inspired the research team to 
enrich their course proposal, investing in a longitudinal pathway 
throughout the medical degree.
Therefore, this group proposes a foundational course that should 
become integral to the medical training curriculum. The course should 
last 4 years, starting from the first year of studies, with consequential 
modules that deepen, each time, different topics. The authors propose 
a four-year course considering the average length of medical education 
programs. In addition, the proposed workshops embedded in each 
year of study will ensure proportionate integration to student’s clinical Moretti et al. 10.3389/fmed.2023.1189126
Frontiers in Medicine 04 frontiersin.orgpractical experience; therefore, this approach will support the student’s 
progression in a reflective and lifelong learning perspective ( 53).
The course will consist of a mix of teaching and learning strategies. 
In addition, the course will provide for each year an analysis of specific 
initial needs (teachers will also use that to reorient the program) and 
an assessment of learning, educational impact, and satisfaction at the 
end of each module. The program is detailed in the table here below.

Frontiers in Medicine 05 frontiersin.org5. Conclusion
Undergraduate medical students have traditionally been exposed 
to biophysical-focused curricula with little attention to patients’ needs 
and expectations. A similar trend has been taking place in clinical 
research. In addition to a specific focus on biological feedback to new 
medications and treatments, men represent the predominant 
population studied.
The predominant role of men in biomedical science has been 
negatively impacting the delivery of high-quality and personalized 
medical care to women. Gender bias is equally in place regarding 
pain assessment and management in the women population. This 
may drastically impact women’s health and well-being, especially 
regarding chronic pain and daily living habits. Our purposive 
literature review and the subsequent exploration of medical schools’ 
curricula have confirmed this concerning trend. Unfortunately, 
we could not ascertain relevant practices in this primary educational 
and medical area as none of the HE  institutions we  contacted 
responded to our questionnaire. Furthermore, only 10 universities 
from the most prestigious academic institutions in the world, as per 
the Top  10 ranking QS Universities Rankings 2022, were 
scrutinized. Despite this may constitute a limitation, the research 
team adopted this strategy due to time constraints and the 
assumption that world-renowned academic institutions would have 
posed much more emphasis on gender bias in medical practice and 
women’s chronic pain management from a 
non-biomedical perspective.
The proposed educational intervention aims to stimulate a debate 
within the scientific community and allow the incorporation of a 
novel approach to limiting the effects of gender bias on future medical 
practitioners. This innovative approach spreads throughout the 
undergraduate medical curriculum, ensuring continuity and 
sustaining an adequate and harmonious development of clinical skills 
and increased awareness in medical students to manage chronic pain 
in the female population appropriately. Furthermore, it is worth 
stressing that gender bias in medical science does not impact 
negatively only on women’s health as medical science must be as 
much as possible inclusive, fair, and open to the full spectrum of 
gender identities.
We recommend this approach in any medical school and 
curriculum cross-contamination in all other allied health professions 
university programs in a lifelong interprofessional perspective.Future studies will include testing the curriculum mentioned 
above development strategy and exploring its actual and perceived 
outcomes on the student population.
