Abstract.  Our study contributes to the history of international medical informatics 
through investigating the thematic evolution of the MEDINFO conferences during 
a period of consolidation and expansion of the discipline. The themes are examined 
and potential factors influencing the evolutionary developments are discussed. 
Keywords.  thematic evolution, biomedical informatics, MEDINFO conferences 
1. Introduction 
The history of sciences and technologies show  a close connection between the evolution 
of different domains, especially in the case of inter-disciplina ry fields [1]. The advent of 
computers stimulated pionee rs in medical informatics, to  propose new applications in 
biomedical research and clinical practice transf orming healthcare worldwide over the 
past century. In this paper,  we investigate the changes in  topics of major interest to 
medical informatics through the lens of them es of papers published in key MEDINFO 
meetings (1986 to 2021) when the field was undergoing dramatic changes due to the 
advances in computational technologies such  as the Internet and World Wide Web. 
Examining the context within  which such changes occurred in biomedicine and 
healthcare allows a deeper understanding of  how various scientific domains interweave, 
and can explain the evolutionary trends. In  our approach, we started with the coalescing 
of the field noted in [2], ad ding the trends from the recent fifteen years and commenting 
on the new emerging topics emerging either due to developments in related fields or 
changing technologies and perspectives which resulted in cross-overs  between the topics 
and changes in the themes that had been predominant earlier. 
2. Background and Method 
A major task of Scientific Committees of conferences is to alloca te accepted papers into 
pre-defined thematic categories. The topics ref lect to a reasonable extent the themes of 
major interest to the field at  the time. During the early stages of the development of 
medical informatics the classification of  the topics usually fell into two major taxonomic

doi:10.3233/SHTI230455176groups. There are those related to operations with information : Data:  types (numerical, 
signals, images), acquisition, storage (databases), retrieva l, processing (biostatistics, 
signals and image analysis), protection; Knowledge : types, extraction (natural language 
processing, data mining, artificial intelligence), representation and use (decision support). 
These contrast to the group which emphasizes the scientific and healthcare technology 
disciplines for informatics application : molecular (bioinformatics), organ (imaging, 
sensors), patient (EHR, primary care, clin ical informatics, nursing), community (hospital 
& health information systems, public health). Sometimes the thematic taxonomy would 
emphasize technologies or methods : new hardware (including interfaces, sensors, 
portable devices, telemedicine), tailored software (clinical, ed ucational), specific 
processing methods (modeling and simulation, pattern recognition, imaging and others). 
However, the theme of a paper is usu ally related to how it addresses readers’ 
interests, defined by the potential impact of  the work, the degree of novelty, cost-
efficiency, regulatory/leg al framework, potential risks, so cio-economic-po litical context, 
accessibility, expected results, etc. So it is hardly surprising that themes and titles of the 
conference sections have changed, requiring reclassifications of papers into timely threads which cross over th e original categories, as for in stance, anticipating informatics 
for the 3
rd millennium in 1998, usability and evaluatio n concerns in 2010, and increasing 
focus on quality, safety and outcomes in 2021. 
The biggest problem was (and still is) th at almost every paper could be allocated 
to several different topics or themes, sinc e in an interdisciplinary field like medical 
informatics each can be categorized by method s, and contributions to specific biomedical 
and healthcare applications – for which the keywords in a paper can provide some 
guidance. the keywords). We  have seen that from a practical perspective there is no 
reasonable way to establish a crisp disjunctive list of non-overlapping topics for a conference , highlighting the job of Scientific Pr ogram Committees (SPCs) is far from 
trivial. Reviewing the contents of MEDINFO Proceedings we have not noticed a coherently contextual taxonomy of topics along the years about the selection along a dominant taxonomic axis. The distribution of pa pers over sections also  shows fairly high 
diversity, from a simple list of a couple of majo r topics up to a higher granularity - major 
themes, main topics and sub- topics, even classifications into  various types – review, 
research, descriptive, opinion/vi sion or demos. Hence, from the very start, we were aware 
that the proportion of certain topics, as ref lected in the contents can give only an 
approximate perspective on the changes of themes and topics in  medical informatics. 
We have considered four time points, somewhat more than a decade apart to 
enhance the detection of significant chan ges. The contents of four MEDINFO’s 
conference proceedings from 1986, 1998, 2010 a nd 2021 have been reviewed [3,4, 5, 6]; 
in order to use relatively uniform time scale but  also to examine how the careful work of 
the corresponding SPCs on paper classification b ased on topics, reflects a higher level of 
detail or granularity facilitati ng a clearer delineation of the major trends. The SPC of 
MEDINFO 86 [3] also correlated the majo r topics with the MeSH terminology. 
The contents of these confer ences were carefully analyzed, taking into account not 
only the initial allocation of a paper to a section, but also the title and the keywords, which were useful for re-allocating some  papers which covered multi-topic themes 
(sometimes based on extra details fro m the paper itself), while trying to keep one paper 
in one category only; for instance, when a pa per had a major topic to develop a software 
for a certain application, it was allocated to softwar e, while when it was about the results 
of its application it was alloca ted to clinical applications; howev er, some papers met both 
conditions and it was allocated to both classes. G. Mihalas and C. Kulikowski / Factors Inﬂuencing the Evolution of Topics 1773. Results 
Our results (Table 1) were obtained by redesigning Table 2 of [2] - redefining the topics 
with an increase in granularity, while adding papers from the 2010 and 2021 MEDINFOs.

4. Discussion 
As mentioned above, the allocation of a pape r to a category does not reflect its full 
covering of topical areas, since we have not  focused on a precise percent for calculations 
of changes but mainly on the major trends, related to the interdisciplinary character of 
medical informatics. There are three main patterns of changes: topics which were of high 
interest initially but then dimini shed in interest, to pics which showed an increasing 
interest, with some of them ev en occurring later, and topics  which maintained a high 
level of interest over the years. One could possibly can add some topics which had a 
relatively short blossoming. Among the top ics with a clear decreasing trend we can cite: 
specific software develo pments, bio-signal analysis and image processing to which we 
can add some topics with a slight decreasing  trend: education, nursing informatics, even 
health information systems. Th e topics which showed an in creasing inter est are mostly 
those related to knowledge processing, with strong interest on ar tificial intelligence, but 
a decrease in decision support. Among the gr owing topics we note th ose related to the G. Mihalas and C. Kulikowski / Factors Inﬂuencing the Evolution of Topics 178challenges and impact of the new technol ogies and methodologies on all aspects of 
medicine and healthcare: evaluation, p atient empowerment organizational and social 
impact, etc. It is very interesting to highlig ht the topics which have endured over the 
years. One of them is databases, which ha d high initial interest, followed by a decrease 
but with a strong comeback lately, related also to  the “big data” tr end, which actually 
brought to light new challenges – data quality, retrieval, curation, mi ning etc. –presenting 
many open problems and challenges yet. Anothe r similar topic is th e patient record; it is 
probably the most specific topic in med ical informatics as the entry gate of “medical 
information as data”; showing how central the EHR is, requiring an entire system of great 
healthcare and economic impact, which exp lains the persistent inter est in the topic.  
We can list a series of factors influen cing these trends: most of the initial work on 
signal and image processing or laboratory data emphasized the bioengineering methods, 
industry then solved most problems based  on technological breakthroughs in informatics 
like CT imaging, while new analytical tech nologies like those from bioinformatics and 
digital data and knowledge bases with distributed online communications enabled the 
Human Genome Project and -omics translation al medicine results. The Internet and 
World Wide Web led to semantic web capa bilities which facilitate higher and higher 
performance for all levels of information sys tems. Most recently  artificial intelligence 
methods have scaled up data-analysis and generative simulation capabilities which are 
frequently opaque and hard to understand, raising complex eth ical and social challenges. 
5. Conclusions 
In general, explanations about the natural evolution of topics of interest in medical 
informatics coincide with our personal experiences over th e years. However, we note 
two aspects that could be analyzed in  greater detail. The first is about whether a study or 
paper should be considered to really fit into the field of medical informatics ? For 
example, a clinical study that uses cytological images for diagnosis or statistical data 
processing is not likely to be classified as a cytology or biostatistics paper. Are clearer 
criteria needed? The second is  related to the criteria for classifying the articles within 
conferences – a more painstaking classification task by the SPCs; would it be helpful to 
have more appropriate sets of keywords to be extended  such that they clearly specify the 
type of technology/method used, application level or how well is the category addressed?  
To conclude, as computational technologies ac hieve ever faster, and more efficient 
performance, human aspects and factors become even more prominent, critical for 
biomedical and healthcare informatics, which place its practitioners in responsible 
positions for designing technologies that will s atisfy the Hippocratic responsibility, while 
implementing the best novel tools fo r clinical practitioners worldwide.
