www.nature.com/scientificreportsSemantic wikis as flexible 
database interfaces for biomedical 
applications
Marco Falda 1*, Manfredo Atzori 1,2,3 & Maurizio Corbetta 1,3,4
Several challenges prevent extracting knowledge from biomedical resources, including data 
heterogeneity and the difficulty to obtain and collaborate on data and annotations by medical 
doctors. Therefore, flexibility in their representation and interconnection is required; it is also 
essential to be able to interact easily with such data. In recent years, semantic tools have been 
developed: semantic wikis are collections of wiki pages that can be annotated with properties and so 
combine flexibility and expressiveness, two desirable aspects when modeling databases, especially 
in the dynamic biomedical domain. However, semantics and collaborative analysis of biomedical data 
is still an unsolved challenge. The aim of this work is to create a tool for easing the design and the 
setup of semantic databases and to give the possibility to enrich them with biostatistical applications. 
As a side effect, this will also make them reproducible, fostering their application by other research 
groups. A command-line software has been developed for creating all structures required by 
Semantic MediaWiki. Besides, a way to expose statistical analyses as R Shiny applications in the 
interface is provided, along with a facility to export Prolog predicates for reasoning with external 
tools. The developed software allowed to create a set of biomedical databases for the Neuroscience 
Department of the University of Padova in a more automated way. They can be extended with 
additional qualitative and statistical analyses of data, including for instance regressions, geographical 
distribution of diseases, and clustering. The software is released as open source-code and published 
under the GPL-3 license at https:// github.  com/ mfalda/ tsv2s wm.
Despite the huge and continuous production of clinical data, their massive exploitation for data science and 
precision medicine remains an unsolved challenge, which semantics and collaborative approaches could con-
tribute to solving.
Every day, thousands of clinical exams are produced and examined by medical doctors worldwide, leading 
to massive amounts of data produced yearly and making healthcare data one of the biggest and still unexploited 
digitized resources of knowledge. Medical data include many diverse data types (e.g. bio-images, bio-signals, 
text, genetics, and many others), which are collected with various acquisition devices and protocols making data 
highly  heterogeneous1–3. The complexity and heterogeneity of biomedical datasets make it difficult to quickly get 
critical information about specific genes, illnesses, and treatments for precision medicine applications, as well 
as to perform knowledge extraction or data mining. Moreover, examining these massive datasets and combin-
ing the results from various sources is in most cases time-consuming and  complicated4. Biomedical datasets 
are increasingly made publicly available leading to thousands of potentially available multi-modal data, e.g. 
from  challenges5–7, open-access  databases8–12, and scientific  literature13. Some examples of online databases are 
 UniProt14 which aims to provide comprehensive and high-quality resources on protein sequences and functional 
information and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), a professional knowledge base for 
the biological interpretation of large-scale molecular datasets, such as genomic and metagenomic  sequences15.
Semantic-based approaches represent an extraordinary and increasingly exploited opportunity for biomedical 
sciences because they allow to create a unique, multilingual representation of medical concepts.
While in Linguistics Semantics refers to the meaning of words, phrases, or sentences, in Computer Science 
Semantics refers to the study of properties, categories, and relationships among concepts of a specific  area16. OPEN

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Supported by formal ontologies, Semantic web technology has been adopted widely in Biomedicine for stand -
ardizing and connecting semantic datasets that are available online and accessible via the HTTP  protocol17. For 
instance, the Semantic MEDLINE  Database18 is a repository of predicates from MEDLINE titles and  abstracts19. 
Percha et al.20 extract relations from unstructured natural language texts in biomedical literature databases. 
Semantic web technology is the focus of Web 3.021 and the most important stack for data integration so far. It is 
built as a set of flexible and inter operable formats and  technologies22,23, mostly based on the Resource Description 
Framework (RDF)24, and its query language SPARQL Protocol And RDF Query Language (SPARQL)25. Despite 
this, semantic database interfaces are still a rather difficult instrument for people who are not used to them, and 
raw SPARQL queries may be challenging to formulate for users without technical training; composing a good 
query also needs high familiarity with the  dataset26.
Together with data and semantics, collaborative approaches represent a great opportunity for biomedical 
sciences, as they can allow the global advancement of biomedical data analysis. During the Web 2.0 revolu-
tion, wiki systems had wide success thanks to highly diffuse collaborative projects such as Wikipedia; wikis are 
websites that can be easily created and edited using a simple markdown syntax and so they are well-fitted for 
less technically versed  people27. Several systems have been proposed in order to merge the best features of wiki 
systems and ontologies, for example  Ontowiki28,  KnowWE29, or  Loki30.
One of the most complete and well-maintained systems in this context is Semantic Mediawiki (SMW)31,32, 
which is an extension of MediaWiki, the engine underlying Wikipedia. Semantic MediaWiki allows for annotat-
ing pages with semantic properties in a well-defined way and retrieving them later using simple queries; in this 
way, information will not get lost in weakly structured textual content. In fact, it enables wikis to present their 
knowledge in a computer-processable fashion.
Semantic MediaWiki has been used in several fields, for example smart  cities33, historical  studies34, or Biology 
 catalogs35. Thanks to the completeness of the provided tools and to its ease of use, Semantic MediaWiki seems 
to be an ideal tool for all scenarios with highly dynamic data structures, such as biomedical research, in which 
multiple scopes and aims can exist in different groups, changing through the lifetime of datasets.
Semantic MediaWiki is commonly used, along with MediaWiki templates and further extensions like 
 PageForms36, to generate the entities needed by each application. Currently, the set of support pages can be 
managed with the Page Schemata  extension37, which stores all the needed structures in an eXtensible Markup 
Language (XML) format embedded in the category pages. However, this software is not easy to manage, and this 
is even more problematic when the number of properties increases considerably; The extension is in fact more 
suited to deal with just a few properties and categories.
This work proposes a tool for easing the creation of semantic databases in Semantic MediaWiki. More pre -
cisely, it consists of a command-line application to transform tabular specifications into a set of XML files ready 
to be imported into Semantic MediaWiki, to build the skeleton of semantic databases. There is also the possibil-
ity to fill in the prepared schema starting from data in a tabular format, which is common in products such as 
Microsoft Excel or OpenCalc. Note that the schema itself does not have any constraint on the properties and 
categories, besides those imposed by Semantic MediaWiki on the available data types, thus it can be used for 
modeling a wide set of scenarios. The generated schema has been empowered by providing a connection to R 
Shiny  applications38 and the possibility to export Prolog predicates through MediaWiki APIs.
Semantic MediaWiki already allows importing page content from a tabular format. There are also tools able 
to import other formats, for example, the PageProperties  extension39 and RDFIO  extension40. The former easily 
associates semantic properties to pages without manual annotation; as far as the import procedure is concerned, 
it allows to map Comma Separated Values (CSV) fields to existing local properties. The latter extension is 
unmaintained. Using the tool described in this paper, there is also the distinctive possibility to design a Semantic 
MediaWiki schema starting from a tabular specification. This allows for easier interaction with end-users and 
makes it possible to delegate to them the design of a first draft that will be closer to their conceptualization.
R Shiny was chosen because it is commonly used for visualizing data and exposing statistical analyses on the 
Web. As far as semantic applications are concerned, some examples are “Semantic Scale Network (beta)” , which 
helps researchers and reviewers in psychological science to detect semantically related  scales41; SemNeT, which 
offers researchers several tools for the analysis of their semantic network  data42; Word Space Creator, which allows 
users to create semantic space models  easily43. There are also tools for extracting knowledge from texts, like for 
instance the paper by Papadias, Kokle, and  Tomai44. They are all interesting, but they are very specific applica -
tions focused on particular research needs or contexts. Our aim is instead to allow a biostatistician to develop 
their own data analysis software and to integrate the resulting application in Semantic MediaWiki accessing the 
underlying semantic data in a simple way right from R. To our knowledge, the most similar system is WINFRA, 
a Web-based platform for Semantic Data Retrieval and Data  Analytics45; it seems very interesting because it 
integrates several analysis tools, and it should be also able to extract triples from free unstructured texts. However, 
it is not publicly available and therefore it was not possible to evaluate it.
As for the actual integration of R Shiny in MediaWiki, specific extensions were considered. More precisely, 
the extensions “R”46 and the extension “Shiny”47. Unfortunately, both are either archived or unmaintained. In 
the latter case, as warned in the extension site, it can be dangerous to use. Moreover, since the R code should be 
written directly in MediaWiki, they are cumbersome to use for a biostatistician, who traditionally works with 
higher level and more helpful programming environments such as, for example, RStudio. Finally, there are no 
indications about how to collect data from the internal Semantic MediaWiki database.
Overall, the proposed system allows to extend and query the site in a very versatile way not only as far as 
the visualization of collected data is concerned but also by providing a gateway for statistical, (fuzzy) logical 
 reasoning48,49, and possibly predictive  analyses50. Since the setup of such a system is very complex, a set of three 
Docker images orchestrated by Compose has been provided.3

Semantic MediaWiki foundations. The fundamental units of Semantic MediaWiki are the pages, as 
usual in any wiki. Being an extension of MediaWiki, the language for formatting text is the wikitext  markup51 
and it is possible to categorize pages for easier organization. The innovative point of Semantic MediaWiki is that 
pages can also be annotated with properties associated with a type, and this allows for using them almost auto-
matically for various operations on data; in this sense, they can be defined as “semantic properties” , in addition 
to the more traditional meaning related to the machine-processability of information and exchange between 
 agents52,53.
The most common use of Semantic MediaWiki is to structure a wiki as a database, and to this aim, the 
MediaWiki templates are essential since they ensure uniformity in annotations; they can be seen as lexical 
transformations like C macros being the output of the preprocessor still a (wiki)text54. Through templates, it is 
also possible to associate categories to pages, which correspond to Ontology Web Language (OWL)  classes55. 
These are very useful not only for organizing content but also for subsequent queries and can be thought of as 
tables in relational terms. Categories are also the link between pages and the forms provided by the PageForms 
 extension36. Thanks to this extension it is indeed possible to generate a template for the pages of a given category, 
and obtain in this way an association between the properties in the template and the input controls in the forms.
Once data have been modeled as page properties, it is possible to consult the site through special associated 
pages or with a multifaceted search interface provided by the Semantic Drilldown  extension56. A more flexible 
method is to use simple queries which have a syntax similar to the categories and properties annotations and use 
the so-called “printouts” to define projections, that is variables prefixed with a ‘?’ , like in SPARQL. These queries 
are known as “ask queries” . For example to retrieve all patients with a temperature greater than 37◦ and report 
their temperature the following query can be specified:
Note that there is a reference category, which is used to select pages and their properties.
Wikis are not Content Management System (CMS) and therefore they are not designed to manage user access 
rights. Ad hoc  extensions have been created, for example, the SemanticACLs  extension57 to emulate such func -
tionalities by assigning roles to users or groups, or the Lockdown extension, which can protect special  pages58.
Query results are typically presented as tables, however, there are other possible representations, thanks to 
the semantic nature of properties. The Semantic Results  extension59 provides several additional formats, while 
the Maps  extension60 allows for placing entities on geographical maps using the coordinates associated with a 
property of them; also charts can be traced on query results.
Semantic MediaWiki enhancements. Several aspects of Semantic MediaWiki were addressed and 
extended: semantic properties for annotating wiki pages and querying them, format facilities to display results, 
and the command-line tool for generating pages with the previous features starting from a TSV file. In Fig.  1, 
they have been highlighted in purple.
Database querying. As far as queries are concerned, the multifaceted search interface provided by the Semantic 
Drilldown extension (SDD)56 has been enriched with groups of properties and the possibility to save selections 
as ASK queries (vide supra ). When properties belonging to pages with different categories are to be retrieved 
together, there must be a connection property, and property chains must be provided. Expanding on the previ-
Figure 1.  SMW aspects that have been extended: several SMW aspects have been extended and they have

otherwise they have been represented by rectangles [Created with Inkscape 1.1.2 (b8e25be833, 2022-02-05) by

www.nature.com/scientificreports/ous example, suppose that there is a “Has Patient” relation between Patients and Samplings, then all patients with 
a temperature greater than 37◦ that have a positive sampling can be retrieved, and temperature and sampling 
reported; observe that a property chain must be used also in the printout and that may be also inverse (minus 
sign prefixed):
To help with property chains, a custom extension has been developed to auto-complete  them61. When writing 
a query, it is sufficient to specify the category and the list of its properties, possibly associated with a filter (Fig.  2).
User management. Five groups of users have been envisioned: sysops  have read/write permissions to all pages 
and administrative privileges; editors  have read/write permissions to data pages and possibly a few other auxil-
iary pages; viewers  have read-only permissions to data pages and possibly to a few other auxiliary pages; export-
ers can only export data from special pages; guests  can just write and read data pages but not query them. The 
SDD extension is aware of the group and it allows for exporting results only to the users belonging to the export-
ers’ group. Also, the general export facility and the ask queries are available exclusively to these users. Notice that 
user groups are not mutually exclusive, for example, a viewer could also export.
Data exploration. A more versatile way to extend representations has been developed: a link with R scripts and 
Shiny web apps. It was built using widgets, a sort of JavaScript modules in MediaWiki. R Shiny applications can 
query the Semantic MediaWiki site using MediaWiki APIs, and for easing this task auxiliary R functions have 
been implemented for retrieving all properties or data by composing a well-formed query starting from its basic 
components. The code is in the Github repository at https:// github. com/ mfalda/ tsv2s wm and in Appendix S1, 
Source Code S1.1. Additional overlays for representing anatomical maps have been created using pyramidal 
 tiles62.
Schemata design and creation. Medical doctors very often collect data in Microsoft Excel and, in general, the 
tabular format is also quite versatile for specifying a schema and even for sharing it. Semantic MediaWiki can

www.nature.com/scientificreports/import XML documents, but this is a format that has been designed to be easily parseable by machines while 
for (non-trained) humans it is difficult and very redundant: the Tab Separated Values (TSV), which mimics a 
simple table, is a more straightforward format. For this reason, a command line software for transforming from 
a conveniently crafted TSV file to Semantic MediaWiki XML has been developed. The grammar of the tabular 
input schemata is reported in Supplementary, Source Code S2.1, in the usual Backus-Naur  form63 and, as it can 
be seen, most basic SMW types and constructs have been taken into account.
Three main functionalities have been implemented: 
1. Generate the schema from a semantically enriched TSV format. The TSV has been enriched (semantically) 
in order to express several features of Semantic MediaWiki such as categories and their hierarchies, auxiliary 
pages, domains of categorical fields, numerical ranges, and so on.
2. Translate a TSV table into an XML file ready to be imported into Semantic MediaWiki.
3. Generate a TSV table or an XML data file filled according to the constraints in point 1.
The command-line tool has been developed in C# (.Net Core); more details are reported in Supplementary 
Materials, Appendix S3. C# is a programming language that has the speed of development typical of dynamic 
languages like Python and Perl and the rigor of strongly typed languages such as Java and C++. It also provides 
convenient functional constructs in the form of Language-INtegrated Query (LINQ) expressions though it does 
not have the powerful type system of true functional languages like Scala or  Haskell64.
Qualitative survey on usability and relevance. To obtain qualitative feedback from colleagues, a short 
survey was submitted to different clinical units within the department. It was composed of five questions based 
on a scale from 1 (easy) to 5 (hard) plus a neutral position (“Don’t remember”): 
1. How easy is data exploration?
2. How quick is data entry?
3. How intuitive is the interface?
4. How useful are statistical graphs?
5. How appropriate is data export?
Additional free text fields were provided for general comments and notes.
Results
Semantic databases creation. The results of this work include both the automatic generation of build-
ing blocks starting from TSV schemata and data and the extension of the basic representations using R Shiny 
applications. This eased the creation of several database schemata containing tens or hundreds of properties. The 
work in this paper was developed for providing a set of databases at the Neuroscience Department, University 
of Padova. Their schemata have been proposed to several research groups: 12 databases have been prepared for 
very diverse research fields such as Neurology, Otorhinolaryngology (ORL), or Psychiatry (Table  1). More are 
planned.
As a reference and complete example, a database inspired by the COVID-19 virus study  in65 has been created 
using their public data. Additional fields filled with random data were added in order to show all the features 
provided by the software, such as geographical locations. All plots and maps in the following have been built 
from these data.

Database querying and data exploration. Ternary predicates representing subject, property, and 
object are generated ready to be easily imported into a Prolog interpreter, and then queried. For example, the 
following query gets all the patients with a temperature greater than 37◦:
An ad hoc  pack66 that provides predicates for logging into Semantic MediaWiki, loading predicates, and 
querying them directly from SWI-Prolog has been developed. The synopsis of the main ask_query /8 predicate is:

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Complex properties, which are typical of medical domains, can be enriched with additional information. For 
example, in the Audiology schema properties range from 1 to 11 words (in Italian, acronyms are used and some 
invariable words omitted, as usual), the longest being the following one, translated into English:
 “Pure tone average of vocal gain during last control exam with an intracochlear device on left ear. ”
The previous complex property can be modeled as in Fig.  4 and vertices can be embedded in the property 
page itself using custom relations, such as those indicated in the figure.
Using such modeling, the exported Prolog predicates would be like the following:
 which could be queried for example as
 Obviously, some of the previous clauses could be also omitted to obtain wider result sets.
The R data frame format is perhaps less useful, as it could also be obtained using the read.table  function in 
R starting from a CSV file already exportable from Semantic MediaWiki, or from the Excel export format using 
the functions in the readxl package, possibly specifying additional import options. As said before, the first idea 
is used also for the embedded Shiny web applications.
Statistical applications.  To demonstrate the benefits of connecting to R Shiny, some descriptive statistics sample 
applications and tests on bivariate public or random data have been created, ready to be further developed; they 
are already apt to get an idea about data distribution and relations. In particular, there are pie and bar graphs 
with associated p values obtained from proportion tests adjusted with Benjamini–Hochberg False Discovery 
Rate (FDR) (Fig.  5a), histograms (Fig.  5b), box plots (Fig.  5c), and scatter plots (Fig.  5d). As an example, graphs 
could be partitioned with facets: it all depends on the underlying R code, which will certainly be easy for an 
average biostatistician. Applications can also become more complex, for example in the box plots application 
associated analyses depending on the underlying distributions have been added; in the scatter plot application 
linear regression fitting.
Maps. Maps have been added both using the Map extension and by developing an R application. In the latter 
case, more advanced features can be implemented. As an example, in the case of anatomical maps, placeholders’ 
radii have been related to the cardinality of the set of patients having a particular random symptom (Fig.  6b),

possible data analyses and representations are only limited by the underlying R framework.
Answers to the qualitative survey. Out of the 8 sub-units for which the 12 implemented databases were devel-
oped (Table  1), 5 replied. The results were encouraging, having an average score of 4.3±0.48 over a maximum 
of 5. More details have been reported in Supplementary Materials, Appendix S5.
The first question about the ease of data exploration obtained an average score of 4.4±0.5 over 5. Ques-
tion 2 on the speed of entry received a low vote scoring an average of 3.4±1.6 over 5. Question 3 is about the 
user interface and received an average score of 4.2±0.8 . Question 4 refers to plots and statistical analyses, and 
received a score of 4.3±0.5 , however, it presents a slice of unexpressed opinions. The last question obtained the 
lowest number of answers and scored an average of 4.7±0.6.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/Discussion
This work presents a first, complete tool for designing a Semantic MediaWiki instance to be used as a semantic 
database enriched with statistical analyses. The choice of R Shiny as the underlying engine for computations 
permits extending it with a wide range of embedded interactive applications.
In fact, this software should allow for a more straightforward and direct design process and foster a potentially 
widespread adoption of such a flexible semantic platform as Semantic MediaWiki in all those data modeling 
scenarios in which one or more “one-to-many relations” are present in the design due to functional dependencies 
in the data themselves. In the case annotations can be linked to known formal (bio)-ontologies, special semantic 
properties can be used to establish equivalences translated into owl:SameAs statements, and in this way differ -
ent datasets can be connected and collaboration on inter-specialty data becomes possible, possibly leading to a 
globally “Medical scientific wiki database” .
The database built by importing the XML file generated by tsv2smw is already using simple forms for 
entering data based on the PageForms extension. The only attention was to provide a uniqueness check, since 
the unique  constraint in Semantic MediaWiki merely signals conflicts but does not prevent them. It was indeed 
decided to name the entities with progressive numbers, in order to implement a more general abstraction. In 
fact, when personal details are modeled it would perhaps be simpler to use personal data for identifying them 
uniquely. However, there is a MediaWiki facility named  DISPLAYTITLE67 which allows for changing dynami-
cally the titles of the pages therefore this should not be a problem.
Another interesting point that has been addressed is the explicit representation of missing data: besides the 
usual  classification68, a field could be without a value because it has not yet been considered, therefore some 
Boolean properties have been extended to a “three-valued” logic that allows for a third possibility which stands 
for “not available” (“tertium datur” ).
Currently, the system is hosted in a closed intranet behind perimeter firewalls, and in exported data, sensi -
tive information is omitted. Should privacy concerns arise, a symmetric deterministic client-side  encryption69 
will be enforced on certain sensitive fields that are not useful for downstream processing. An important point 
will be the treatment of geographical coordinates since they are sensitive but useful for geographic clustering; a 
possible solution will be to aggregate locations until a certain population threshold will be reached, in order to 
make individuals identification very hard. More pervasive data alterations should be limited since analyses on 
encrypted data would be more complex to  manage50. Two-factor authentication is available to users.
Prolog predicates could be more familiar and simpler than SPARQL syntax for some users and this language 
is already adopted in some systems such as  AllegroGraph70 or  Loki30; its syntax is not difficult, being based on 
facts, rules, and  goals71. To be able to operate directly from the site, a special page based on Tau-Prolog72, an 
open-source Prolog interpreter written in JavaScript, could be included in order to perform limited-depth que-
ries. Alternatively, a SWISH embedded  site73 could be added. In both cases, a set of predefined queries could be 
provided according to the underlying properties and types.

www.nature.com/scientificreports/The possibility of interfacing R scripts is ideal for better decoupling the development of (intelligent) analysis 
modules by people with more specialized skills: a biostatistician could comfortably work in his own development 
environment and then transfer the application she created to the developer in order to integrate it in the site.
Also, Anatomical maps can be created using R and they can be used to trace, for example, the successive 
locations of tumor relapses in individual patients or, given a location, all patients with that particular symptom 
(Fig.  6b). The advantage of a “symbolic” approach is that a first level of abstraction is already introduced, which 
could be further exploited through hierarchical clustering or clustering on categories. All this expressive power 
comes precisely from the possibility to use R, or also another data analysis framework, for dealing with data.
Some limitations emerged and will be addressed. First, the flexibility of the underlying TSV schema should 
be enhanced, since there persist some peculiarities typical to the context in which the system is currently used, 
namely the core patient-visit relation at the base of all the currently developed databases. This flexibility requires 
careful parsing of the feeble structure equipping the TSV input files. It could be also useful to give the possibility 
to operate on differential TSV schemata in order to make maintenance easier and allow for simpler amendments.
Another critical aspect concerns the possibility of sharing common categories in a wiki-farm configuration. 
To segregate relevant data to different research groups, a more robust and secure way is to set up a set of wikis; 
an alternative would be to configure a single site using namespaces. In this case, a triple-store could be a viable 
solution, and greater integration of Semantic MediaWiki with Wikidata or SPARQL endpoints , in general, 
would be ideal.
A system validation among users demonstrated the usability of the developed Semantic MediaWiki interface 
by bio-medical users and it suggested improvements for future interface development. There were no major nega-
tive comments by collaborators related to data exploration (Question 1). According to users’ answers, semantic 
properties and data exploration are topics of interest and could benefit biomedical researchers’ work. Data entry 
is time-consuming, which may explain the relatively low scores (Question 2). The input controls are in standard 
HTML, and they cannot be made easier. Question 3 is about the “intuitiveness” of the system. The relatively 
low scores reflect, in our opinion, the organization of the menu commands. This aspect could be improved by 
instrumenting the graphical interface and timing the users’ mouse actions. Question 4 was about statistical 
graphs and received relatively few answers, possibly because the end-users are medical doctors who are not as 
familiar with statistics. Those who voted indicated high interest, revealing the importance of a tool for statisti -
cally plotting the results. The last question was about data export, and it received few answers. This result might 
be due to the relatively small amount of stored data. Also, biostatisticians use this function more commonly 
than medical doctors we used to test the survey. Data export can improve by making the format similar to the 
more familiar Excel sheets.
Conclusion
Semantic databases built with wiki platforms are flexible and easy for end-users even in the case of complex 
biomedical data, thanks to the possibility to extend them and to customize the interface, however, they must 
be created manually or through embedded forms, and therefore it is difficult to create and manage large sets of 
properties with them.
In this paper, a tool for creating Semantic MediaWiki XML schemata from specifications in a simple TSV 
format has been proposed along with a method for embedding statistical applications in R Shiny and for export-
ing Prolog predicates. This allows for increasing the expressiveness of the platform by producing plots, statistical 
analyses, and rich maps. Additional embedded applications will be studied for other data types, for example, 
survival curves for time series, Gaussian mixture models for spatial clustering, and Natural Language Processing 
algorithms for medical reports.
Data availability
A demonstration of the system containing public data adapted from a study about COVID-1965 with additional 
random data is available online at https:// dbnsd emo. neuro scien ze. unipd. it; access can be allowed by the cor -
responding author on reasonable request.
Code availability
Since the setup process involving Semantic MediaWiki and its required extensions, the R Shiny server, and an 
underlying relational database management system is very complex, a set of Docker images orchestrated by 
Compose has been created. All code has been published as open-source with GNU Public License v3 and it is 
available at https:// github.  com/  mfalda/  tsv2s  wm and https:// github.  com/  mfalda/  docker- smw  (Supplementary 
materials, Appendix S4).
