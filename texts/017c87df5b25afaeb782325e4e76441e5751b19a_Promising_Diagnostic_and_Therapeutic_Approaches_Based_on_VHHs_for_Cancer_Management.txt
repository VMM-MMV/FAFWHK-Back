Simple Summary: With around 15 kD molecular weight, VHHs are considered the smallest antigen-
binding fragments. Based on their unique properties, VHHs have broad application prospects such
as bio-sensing, molecular imaging, drug delivery, disease treatments, and diagnosis. In this review,
we discuss VHH applications for cancer treatments and diagnosis. Meanwhile, an overview of
VHH-based agents in clinical trials is provided.
Abstract: The discovery of the distinctive structure of heavy chain-only antibodies in species be-
longing to the Camelidae family has elicited significant interest in their variable antigen binding
domain (VHH) and gained attention for various applications, such as cancer diagnosis and treatment.
This article presents an overview of the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of VHHs as
compared to conventional antibodies, and their usage in diverse applications. The singular properties
of VHHs are explained, and several strategies that can augment their utility are outlined. The preclin-
ical studies illustrating the diagnostic and therapeutic efficacy of distinct VHHs in diverse formats
against solid cancers are summarized, and an overview of the clinical trials assessing VHH-based
agents in oncology is provided. These investigations demonstrate the enormous potential of VHHs
for medical research and healthcare.

1. Introduction
In 1993, a different type of antibody called heavy chain only antibody (HCAb) was dis-
covered in camelids, which had another structure compared with conventional antibodies
(Figure 1) [ 1]. Another type of antibody lacking light chains is also found in cartilaginous
fish [ 2,3]. HCAbs only contain two heavy chains, each one bearing beside two constant
regions CH2 and CH3 also a variable region. This variable region is also called the vari-
able domain of heavy chain of heavy-chain-only antibody (VHH), can be recombinantly
produced and has a molecular weight of only about 15 kD, which is 10% of a conventional
antibody and half of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv). Therefore, VHHs are also
called single domain antibodies (sdAb) or nanobodies.
While conventional antibodies have been used in anti-cancer therapies for many years,
VHH-based therapies have more recently started to be explored. The unique features of
VHH, such as high affinity and lower immunogenicity, may provide important differences
in anti-cancer therapies. To date, preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials have
demonstrated the promising potential of VHH for cancer management. In this review, we
provide an overview of VHH characteristics and the general route of VHH development.

Furthermore, we summarize the applications of VHH in anti-cancer therapies and provide
an overview of registered clinical trials testing VHH-based therapeutic and diagnostic
agents for oncological diseases.

While conventional antibodies have been used in anti-cancer therapies for many 
years, VHH-based therapies have more recent ly started to be explored. The unique fea-
tures of VHH, such as high a ﬃnity and lower immunogenicity, may provide important 
diﬀerences in anti-cancer therapies. To date, preclinical studies and early-stage clinical 
trials have demonstrated the promising potential of VHH for cancer management. In this 
review, we provide an overview of VHH characteristics and the general route of VHH 
development. Furthermore, we summarize the applications of VHH in anti-cancer thera-pies and provide an overview of registered c linical trials testing VHH-based therapeutic 
and diagnostic agents for oncological diseases. 
2. General Characteristics of VHH 
In VHH, there are only three complement arity-determining regions (CDRs) that 
make contact with the antigen, as compared to six in conventional antibodies (3 in VH and 3 in VL). To compensate for this and to ensure su ﬃcient contact interface, the amino chain 
in CDR3 (and to a lesser extent CDR1) is longer in VHH than its counterpart in conven-
tional antibodies [4,5]. As a result, the diversity and speci ﬁcity of CDR3 is improved. Ad-
ditionally, CDR3 in VHH can make up an expo sed ring structure, which can behave like 
a ‘ﬁnger’ to stick into the ‘pocket’ of antigen, where a conventional antibody rather inter-
acts with ﬂat surfaces [6–9]. In addition, an extra cysteine residue in CDR3 can form a 
disulﬁde bond with an extra cysteine residue in either CDR1 or in the framework region 
2 (FR2), which increases the stability of th e VHH structure, while decreasing the energy 
requested for binding with antigens [4,5]. 
2.1. Biochemical and Biop hysical Characteristics 
The unique biochemical and biophysical characteristics of VHH are their stability, in 
addition to high solubility, thermo- and proteolytic-resistance [10]. FR2 contains many 
hydrophilic amino acid residues, which determi nes the high solubility and dispersibility 
of VHH in water. VHH has also good conforma tional and thermal stability, which allows 
VHH to be stable at body temperatur e during a week while still having su ﬃcient binding 
ability [11]. Additionally, VHH is also stable at extreme pH conditions, ensuring that VHH 
maintains its bioactivity in the stomach or the intestine [12–15]. The stability of VHH 
makes it possible to design VHH treatments  following various administration methods, 
including intravenous injection, inhalation, and oral and intranasal administration. Alto-
gether, the stable biochemical and biophysical properties nurture the increasing applica-
tions of VHH. 
2.2. Low Immunogenicity 
Relatively li ttle scienti ﬁc evidence is publicly available to make strong claims about 
the immunogenicity of VHHs. Nevertheless, th e structure of VHH has a high similarity 
with the human VH structure, in particular , it has a high homology (86–94%) with the

2. General Characteristics of VHH
In VHH, there are only three complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) that make
contact with the antigen, as compared to six in conventional antibodies (3 in VH and 3 in
VL). To compensate for this and to ensure sufficient contact interface, the amino chain in
CDR3 (and to a lesser extent CDR1) is longer in VHH than its counterpart in conventional
antibodies [ 4,5]. As a result, the diversity and specificity of CDR3 is improved. Additionally,
CDR3 in VHH can make up an exposed ring structure, which can behave like a ‘finger’ to
stick into the ‘pocket’ of antigen, where a conventional antibody rather interacts with flat
surfaces [ 6–9]. In addition, an extra cysteine residue in CDR3 can form a disulfide bond
with an extra cysteine residue in either CDR1 or in the framework region 2 (FR2), which
increases the stability of the VHH structure, while decreasing the energy requested for
binding with antigens [4,5].
2.1. Biochemical and Biophysical Characteristics
The unique biochemical and biophysical characteristics of VHH are their stability, in
addition to high solubility, thermo- and proteolytic-resistance [ 10]. FR2 contains many
hydrophilic amino acid residues, which determines the high solubility and dispersibility
of VHH in water. VHH has also good conformational and thermal stability, which allows
VHH to be stable at body temperature during a week while still having sufficient binding
ability [ 11]. Additionally, VHH is also stable at extreme pH conditions, ensuring that VHH
maintains its bioactivity in the stomach or the intestine [ 12–15]. The stability of VHH makes
it possible to design VHH treatments following various administration methods, including
intravenous injection, inhalation, and oral and intranasal administration. Altogether, the
stable biochemical and biophysical properties nurture the increasing applications of VHH.
2.2. Low Immunogenicity
Relatively little scientific evidence is publicly available to make strong claims about
the immunogenicity of VHHs. Nevertheless, the structure of VHH has a high similarity
with the human VH structure, in particular, it has a high homology (86–94%) with the
human VH3 family [ 16,17]. The relatively small size of VHH (125 amino acids) implies a
low number of potentially immunogenic epitopes. The high solubility of VHHs reduces the
likeliness to form highly immunogenic aggregates. Moreover, unmodified VHHs show fast
blood clearance, which minimizes capture by antigen-presenting cells. All these features
favor low immunogenicity. In a phase I clinical study of68Ga-HER2-VHH, 20 patients
were free of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) after one injection [ 18]. A phase I study of ALX-
0141, a trimeric format consisting of two identical anti-RANKL humanized VHHs and oneCancers 2024 ,16, 371 3 of 25
anti-albumin humanized VHH, demonstrated that after a single subcutaneous injection
in 42 healthy volunteers, no ADAs were found [ 19]. In summary, the immunogenicity
of VHH in humans seems to be relatively low, which prevents one of the main causes of
adverse effects, i.e., allergy. Humanization of VHH is possible and can further reduce its
immunogenicity [20–22].
2.3. High Tissue Penetration and Fast Blood Clearance
Theoretically, the passive diffusion rate of a molecule in tissue is inversely proportional
to its molecular size. Therefore, compared with conventional antibody (150 kD), the mono-
valent VHH (15 kD) has a fast blood extravasation and a better tissue penetration to reach
its target. This results in a more homogeneous distribution, for example in solid tumors,
compared to conventional antibodies [ 23–26]. It has been shown that VHHs can cross the
blood-brain barrier (BBB) of healthy rats [ 27], providing improved ability for the diagnosis
and treatment of brain cancer, where in addition the BBB is likely disrupted [28–32]. Due
to the small molecular weight, VHH is usually cleared quickly through the kidneys [ 33–36].
As a result, the half-life time of VHH in the human body is mostly less than an hour [ 37,38],
a feature helpful to prevent toxicity. Although the short half-life of VHH is advantageous
for diagnostic applications, it may limit its therapeutic efficacy [ 39–41]. Methods such as
PEGylation, fusion or binding with albumin, multimerization, or fusion with antibody Fc
can help to extend the half-life [ 42–47]. For example, a bivalent anti-VEGF VHH showed a
1.8-fold longer half-life in comparison with the monovalent VHH [ 42]. PEGylation resulted
in a 12-fold longer half-life of an anti-CEA/CD3 bispecific VHH [45].
3. The Generation of VHH
There are several steps in the identification of a functional VHH.
1. The construction of a VHH gene library
The first step in the generation of antigen-specific VHHs is to construct a VHH-
encoding cDNA library. Antigen-specific VHHs can be retrieved either from an immune
VHH library, a naive VHH library, or a synthetic VHH library. The immune library is the
most frequently used method, exploiting the in vivo affinity maturation of the VHHs. To
construct an immune library, camelid animals are immunized with a targeted antigen. The
targeted antigen is injected into camelids multiple times, e.g., 7 times every two weeks [ 48].
5~7 days after the immunization lymphocytes are then extracted from the peripheral blood,
which contains B cells producing the matured HCAbs. Lymphocyte RNA is extracted and
reverse transcribed into cDNA [ 49]. The bulk of cDNA is used as a template for PCR with
VHH-specific primers [ 50]. Subsequently, the amplified VHH DNA fragments are cloned
into bacterial vectors to construct the library [51].
2. The selection of specific VHH
Phage display is the dominant technique to screen libraries for functional VHHs. Here,
the VHH immune libraries are cloned in phagemids in fusion with bacteriophage gene III,
and then VHHs are displayed on the tip of the M13 bacteriophage by infection with helper
phages providing phage structural components in trans. The target antigen is fixed directly
or indirectly on a solid carrier, to allow the phage library to interact with the antigen. While
the phages of interest bind with the fixed antigen, unbounded or unspecific phages are
removed by washing. Subsequently, a specific acid (e.g., 0.1 M pH 2.2 HCl-Glycine) or
base (e.g., 0.1 M triethylamine) is used to release the phage from its antigen. Generally,
after 2–5 selection rounds of panning, the VHHs with good specificity and affinity can be
selected [52].
3. The production of VHH
Due to its simple structure and good water solubility, VHH can be mass-produced
by using relatively low-cost expression systems such as bacterial or yeast expression sys-
tems [ 51,53–57]. After verifying the nucleic acid sequence of the selected VHH, an expressionCancers 2024 ,16, 371 4 of 25
vector is constructed and transferred into bacteria (e.g., E. coli BL21) or yeast (e.g., Pichia
pastoris GS115 or X33) for the production of VHH. In the bacteria expression process, suc-
cessfully transformed colonies are picked for culture expansion and induction of VHH pro-
duction. For example, if a Lac-operon is present in the expression vector, IPTG (Isopropyl- β-
D-thiogalactoside) is used to induce gene expression when the bacteria reach the exponential
growth phase. Most often VHHs are transported to the periplasm and extracted from there,
although also cytoplasmic expression is being pursued [ 58]. In the yeast expression pro-
cess, successfully transformed yeast colonies are picked for culture expansion following
induction, with VHHs most often ending up in the conditioned medium due to secretion.
The VHH protein in the supernatant, cell lysates, or periplasmic extracts can be purified
by methods such as affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, or molecular
sieve chromatography. The production of VHHs in mammalian cell lines is rarely reported
because of the high cost of this expression system.
4. Applications of VHH
4.1. Molecular Imaging
Molecular imaging is one of the important methods in cancer research, which allows
the noninvasive study of tumors and their microenvironment, as well as tracing or monitor-
ing cancer progression and therapy effectiveness. Generally, a molecular targeted imaging
agent contains a targeting moiety and a radioisotope for nuclear imaging or a fluores-
cent moiety for optical imaging [ 59]. To target cancer cells more precisely, the imaging
agent is required to have higher specificity and sensitivity, with lower toxicity and fewer
adverse effects.
Conventional antibodies have been frequently tested in cancer molecular imaging
studies [ 60]. However, the application of conventional antibody-based molecular imaging
is rather limited by its large size and relatively long plasma half-life. This requires the use
of radionuclides with a long physical half-life, resulting in more radiation exposure and
additional measures for radiation protection [ 61]. With their smaller molecular weight,
VHHs have a deeper penetration into the central part of solid tumors to detect target
expression [ 62,63]. In addition, the short half-life and fast blood clearance limit non-specific
VHH presence resulting in an improved signal-to-noise ratio and fewer adverse effects.
Therefore, the VHH-based imaging technique is currently heavily investigated for cancer
diagnosis, to target proteins or receptors which are overexpressed in tumor cells or the
tumor microenvironment during cancer progression.
Positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomogra-
phy (SPECT) are the two main nuclear imaging techniques for cancer diagnosis. To improve
the accuracy and specificity and to reduce potential side effects of radiation exposure in
PET/SPECT imaging, the VHH has been used as an ‘immune carrier’ in the construction of
radioactive probes. In the very first study, Gainkam et al. investigated the uptake of the
99mTc labeled anti-EGFR VHH and showed that tumor uptake was correlated with tumor
burden, concluding that the VHH can be used to track the tumor response to therapy [ 34].
Table 1 identifies several preclinical studies on VHH-radionuclide conjugates for imaging.
Clinically, in a phase II study,68Ga labeled anti-HER2 VHH was used to assess HER2
expression in primary breast cancer and metastatic lesions [ 64]. This clinical study showed
that the68Ga-HER2-nanobody could be safely administered, with favorable biodistribution
and high accumulation in HER2-positive primary breast cancer and its metastases. In an-
other recent phase I study, a68Ga-labeled VHH against the macrophage mannose receptor
CD206 was tested in a phase I PET safety study to track tumor-associated macrophages in
the tumor stroma [65]. Other clinical studies are summarized in Table 7.Cancers 2024 ,16, 371 5 of 25

Besides being conjugated with a radionuclide, VHH can also be conjugated with a
fluorescent moiety for molecular imaging [ 85]. For example, Debie et al. extensively evalu-
ated fluorescently labeled anti-HER2 VHH for image-guided surgery and demonstrated a
significant reduction of residual tumor lesions as compared to conventional surgery [ 86,87].
Van Brussel et al. developed a CAIX-specific VHH conjugated to IRDye800CW, that could
visualize tumors compared to the background 2–3 h after the anti-CAIX VHH injection [ 88].
Furthermore, the VHH can also be used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by conjuga-
tion with MRI contrast agents, such as gadolinium or paramagnetic nanoparticles [89,90].
4.2. VHHs in Anti-Cancer Therapies
The unique features that have been discussed above make VHHs promising replace-
ments for monoclonal antibodies or other types of antibody fragments. Figure 2 generally
describes different applications of VHHs in anti-cancer therapies.
4.2.1. Radioimmunotherapy
Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is a “targeted” radionuclide therapy coupling radioiso-
topes with therapeutic properties to antibodies. These antibodies bind to specific targets
in the tumors and deliver their cargo, i.e., the radionuclide, at that site, resulting in min-
imal toxicity to normal tissue [ 91].90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin®, Bayer) and131I-
tositumomab (Bexxar®, GSK) are so far the only two RITs approved for clinical use to treatCancers 2024 ,16, 371 7 of 25
hematological malignancies [ 92,93]. Both are designed based on anti-CD20 monoclonal
antibodies to treat CD20-positive non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The application of
RIT for solid tumor treatment is, however, still a challenge. In addition to the large size of
conventional antibodies, the leakage of tumor blood vessels and the complexity of the ma-
trix in solid tumors make it difficult for RIT to reach all tumor cells. Therefore, alternative
carriers of therapeutic radioisotopes, such as VHHs and peptides have been investigated
for cancer RIT, especially for the treatment of solid tumors.

ground confirmed that the VHH can be used as a molecular 
probe for imaging CEACAM 5-expressing tumors. [82]

* EDB of 
FN 64Cu pan-cancer Targeted the extracellular matr ix to image tumor progression, 
metastasis, and fibrosis. [84] 
* Alternatively spliced EIIIB domain of ﬁbronectin. 
Besides being conjugated with a radionuclide, VHH can also be conjugated with a 
ﬂuorescent moiety for molecular imaging [85]. For example, Debie et al. extensively eval-
uated ﬂuorescently labeled anti-HER2 VHH for image-guided surgery and demonstrated 
a signi ﬁcant reduction of residual tumor lesions as compared to conventional surgery 
[86,87]. Van Brussel et al. developed a CAIX-speci ﬁc VHH conjugated to IRDye800CW, 
that could visualize tumors compared to th e background 2–3 h after the anti-CAIX VHH 
injection [88]. Furthermore, the VHH can also  b e  u s e d  in  m ag n e t i c  r e s o n an c e  i m ag in g  
(MRI) by conjugation with MRI contrast agents, such as gadolinium or paramagnetic na-noparticles [89,90]. 
4.2. VHHs in Anti-Cancer Therapies 
The unique features that have been disc ussed above make VHHs promising replace-
ments for monoclonal antibodies or other type s of antibody fragments. Figure 2 generally 
describes di ﬀerent applications of VHHs in anti-cancer therapies.

Table 2 summarizes the preclinical studies on the application of VHH in RIT of solid
tumors. For example, D’Huyvetter et al. treated mice bearing HER2-positive SKOV3 ovar-
ian adenocarcinoma xenografts with the177Lu-labeled anti-HER2 VHH and demonstrated
that the tumor growth was almost completely inhibited. Moreover, the event-free survival
was significantly longer for the treated group compared to the control group that received
vehicle treatment, while no evidence of renal inflammation or necrosis was observed [ 94].
Similarly, anti-FAP VHHs that are conjugated to131I or225Ac were able to limit tumor
growth and enhance the survival of mice bearing FAP-expressing tumors [ 95]. To target the
TME, Xu et al. generated the anti-FAP α(fibroblast activation protein- α) VHH-Fc fusion
labeled with177Lu and showed therapeutic efficacy in HT1080 fibrosarcoma xenografts
in mice [ 96]. Anti-MMR VHH labeled with177Lu was designed to target the stroma of
solid tumors. The177Lu-labeled anti-MMR VHH significantly delayed tumor growth,
which outcompeted the effects of currently used therapies, such as immune checkpoint in-
hibitors, anti-angiogenic therapy (anti-VEGFR2 mAbs), and chemotherapies (doxorubicin,
paclitaxel) [97].

VHH can be conjugated to a photosensitizer (PS), which is a light-activatable com-
pound that generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species upon activation with a certain
light wavelength [ 104]. These VHH-PS conjugates can also be used as tracers or probes
to monitor tumor progression using optical imaging after photodynamic therapy (PDT).
IRDye700DX, a phthalocyanine dye, is one of the most promising photosensitizers, whose
chemical structure is similar to hematoporphyrin. Its maximum absorption wavelength is
in the infrared wavelength region and therefore easier to be transmitted through human
tissue. Additionally, IRDye has low absorption of light with a wavelength of 400–600 nm,
which reduces the skin photosensitivity reaction. Therefore, many studies have used
IRDye700DX as PS to couple with VHH for PDT. For example, Renard et al. generated
anti-EGFR VHH conjugated with111In-DPTA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid) and
IRDye700DX PS in a site-specific way, which homed to A431 xenografts in vivo and re-
sulted in light-induced toxicity via cellular internalization [ 105]. Deken et al. investigated
anti-HER2 VHH conjugated with IRDye700DX PS that induced significant regression of
trastuzumab-resistant HER2-expressing breast tumors after a single treatment session with
selective cytotoxicity [ 106]. Table 3 summarizes cancer targets investigated using VHH-PS
conjugates in preclinical studies.

4.2.3. VHH as Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor
Several conventional antibodies have been used as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)
for anti-cancer treatments in the past years. However, due to the complex structure of these
antibodies and the tumor heterogeneity, antibody-based ICIs face many challenges such as
insufficient tumor penetration and immune-related adverse effects [ 112], highlighting the
need for optimization of antibody-based ICIs.
Due to the smaller molecular weight, VHHs have a higher penetration potential in
solid tumors. Petit et al. showed that T cell-mediated targeted delivery of an anti-PD-L1Cancers 2024 ,16, 371 9 of 25
VHH outperformed an anti-PD-L1 conventional antibody in inhibiting tumor growth,
related to its higher tumor penetration in MC38 tumor-bearing mice [ 113]. Table 4 sum-
marizes the studies evaluating VHH-based ICIs. Although the VHHs lack ADCC and
CDC due to the absence of Fc fragment, the VHH still has anti-cancer efficacy by inhibiting
the bioactivity of immune checkpoints to attenuate immune suppression in tumors [ 114].
Therefore, fusing VHH with an Fc fragment can also compensate the ADCC and CDC in
anti-cancer therapies [ 115]. Ma et al. demonstrated that a tetravalent anti-PD-L1 VHH-Fc
fusion had a higher inhibitory effect on tumor growth compared to an equimolar dose of an
anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody (Tecentriq analog) in MC38 xenograft-bearing mice [ 116].
Clinically, envafolimab (KN035), anti-PD-L1 VHH-Fc fusion formulated for subcutaneous
injection, has demonstrated a favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profile, with promising
antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors in Phase I–II trials [117–119].

4.2.4. Targeting Tumor-Specific Antigens
Tumor-specific antigens (TSAs) are important targets for cancer treatments and di-
agnosis. However, TSAs are not exclusively expressed in cancer cells. Normal cells may
express TSAs at low levels, while cancer cells have high expression of TSAs during tumor
proliferation. As a consequence, molecules targeting TSAs should have high specificity and
affinity, which can be achieved with VHH.Cancers 2024 ,16, 371 10 of 25
VHHs have been designed to bind tumor-specific targets TSAs such as HER2, EGFR,
and VEGFR, over the past years and they are reported to have anti-tumor efficacy. Table 5
summarizes the preclinical studies evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of various anti-TSA
VHHs. As the small molecular weight of VHH allows better intratumor penetration, it
leads to high VHH clearance resulting in a shorter plasma half-life during the treatment.
In vivo studies showed the half-life of VHH binding with its target within 1–2 h [128,129].
In addition, VHHs are not capable of promoting ADCC or CDC effects during the treatment,
which should also be considered. These two limitations can be overcome by modification
of the VHHs. For example, Sadeghi et al. generated an anti-VEGF bivalent VHH that
showed a 1.8-fold longer half-life compared to its monovalent form [ 42]. An et al. coupled
ABD035 to anti-GPC3 VHH labeled with68Ga, which reached a peak tumor uptake at 6 h
post-injection combined with a reduced kidney accumulation at 1 h post-injection [ 78].
Another method is coupling VHHs with an Fc fragment to obtain the VHH-conjugates with
the ability to promote ADCC or CDC [130].

4.2.5. VHH-Drug Conjugates (VHH-DC)
Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are immune-conjugates formed with a monoclonal
antibody as a ‘delivery carrier’ and a cytotoxic/immune-promoting drug as ‘cargo’, which
are conjugated via a chemical linker [ 144]. Highly specific targeting antibodies are used
to overcome the toxicity and adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. In
addition, the antibody may also have additive or synergistic anti-cancer effects with the
drug, when both components of ADC exhibit anti-tumor effects [ 145]. Nowadays, third-
generation ADCs have been developed and investigated. With novel techniques for ADC
generation, ADCs with high targeting and therapeutic efficacy, relatively low immunogenic-
ity, consistent drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) and low toxicity are becoming available [ 146].
As more ADCs have been entering clinical trials, more challenges for ADC development
have been raised. During the synthesis of ADC, the chemical modification leads to the
instability of monoclonal antibodies. In addition, the high molecular weight makes it
difficult for ADC to enter the inner hypoxic part of solid tumors, which limits the appli-
cation of ADCs in cancer treatments. Using VHHs as a ‘carrier’ of cytotoxic drugs is a
novel alternative to overcome the disadvantages of conventional monoclonal antibodies.
Table 6 summarizes recent VHH-drug conjugates studies. Indeed, Wu et al. demonstrated
that the anti-5T4 VHH-SN38 (irinotecan analog) conjugate was detected at 85 µm from
the periphery of the patient-derived organoids (PDOs), while the anti-5T4 conventional
antibody-SN38 conjugate mainly located around the periphery of PDOs [ 147]. Drug re-
sistance and downregulation of tumor antigens are challenging for ADCs as well [ 148].
Espelin et al. used anti-HER2 VHH conjugated with doxorubicin (MM-302) in combina-
tion with trastuzumab to demonstrate synergistic anti-tumor activity both in vitro and
in vivo , supporting its translation into clinical trials [ 149]. Therefore, other strategies are
being investigated including utilization of novel tumor antigens, antibody formats, linkers,
payloads, etc.Cancers 2024 ,16, 371 12 of 25

4.2.6. VHH-Based CAR-T
The chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is an engineered synthetic receptor that can
redirect lymphocytes to recognize and eliminate specific cells, which express the target anti-
gens [ 153]. T cells are most commonly used to carry CARs, but CARs can also be applied to
other types of immune cells, such as NK cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, etc. [154,155].
Hitherto, six CAR-T therapies have been approved by the FDA to treat relapsed/refractory
multiple myeloma (RRMM), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), mantle cell lym-
phoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, of
which anti-CD19 CAR-T products’ antigen recognition domain is based on the same scFv
(Kymriah®, Yescarta®, Tecartus®, and Breyanzi®), whereas the antigen recognition domain
of B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA, Carvykti®, Legend Biotech and Janssen Biotech) is
based on VHH [ 156]. The peptide linker of scFv-based CAR-T, however, showed immuno-
genicity as neutralizing antibodies were generated against the linker [ 157]. Additionally, T
cell exhaustion is another factor that limits the application of CAR-T, which occurs indepen-
dently of the binding with the target antigen but is caused by the unstable structure of scFv.
The exposed hydrophobic residues in the scFv variable domain and poor VH or VL folding
stability can result in CAR aggregation. The CAR aggregation on the surface of CAR-T
can lead in turn to the activation of effector cells and cytotoxic signaling cascade, which
contribute to T cell exhaustion [ 158,159]. Xie et al. generated VHH-based CAR-T cells,
which were designed to target PD-L1, CD47, or EIIIB+ fibronectin splice variant to target
the TME, and each VHH-based CAR-T could reduce solid tumor growth and improve
survival in immunocompetent tumor-bearing mice [ 160,161]. Rajabzadeh et al. designed anCancers 2024 ,16, 371 13 of 25
anti-MUC1 CAR-T which could increase secretion of Th1 cytokines and cytotoxic activity
that could inhibit cancer cell viability [ 162]. In summary, VHH-based CAR-T is promising
as an approach to treating solid tumors [163].
4.3. Other Applications of VHHs
VHHs can also be applied in other novel anti-cancer treatments. VHH, which binds
and neutralizes cytokines or growth factors such as TNF αor VEGF, respectively, can
attenuate tumor growth by inhibiting metastasis or angiogenesis [ 13,164–166]. Alterna-
tively, VHHs conjugated with proteins (e.g., cucurmosin, pseudomonas exotoxin), cy-
tokines (e.g., IFN γ, IL-2, TNF α) or peptides show promising potential of inhibiting tumor
growth [ 167–171]. Yin et al. investigated an anti-PD-L1 VHH and used it for modified
liposomes co-delivery of simevastatin/gefitinib that could remodel the TME of EGFR-
T790M-mutated NSCLC and overcome the drug resistance [ 172]. Furthermore, VHHs can
be used to construct cancer vaccinations. For example, conjugating anti-CD11b VHH with
H-2Db-restricted immunodominant E7 epitope (E749-57), which exists in high-risk human
papillomavirus-associated cancers, induced stronger CD8+T-cell responses against HPV
positive tumors than E749-57 alone [ 173]. The tumor vaccine that contains anti-CD47 VHH
could induce suppression of tumor progression and improve the long-term survival of
tumor-bearing mice by remodeling the TME [ 174]. Altogether, VHHs have great poten-
tial to develop novel anti-cancer therapies with higher efficacy and lower toxicity, which
warrants further investigations.
5. An Overview of Ongoing Clinical Trials of VHHs in Cancer Treatments
With the failure of many promising anti-cancer therapies in clinical trials and un-
derstanding the progression of cancer, more strict safety and efficacy requirements have
been raised for the investigation of cancer treatments. Since the discovery of VHHs in
1993, VHH have become a promising agent for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, viral
infection [41,175,176], and other diseases due to its unique structure and physicochemical
properties. The CAR-T, in which anti-BCMA VHHs serve as antigen receptors on T cells
(Carvykti®, Legend Biotech, and Janssen Biotech), has been approved by the FDA for the
treatment of advanced multiple myeloma in 2022. Meanwhile, many clinical trials evaluat-
ing the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of VHH-based agents in solid and hematological
malignancies are ongoing. Table 7 summarizes some of these clinical trials. Data was collected

6. Discussion and Future Directions
Since its discovery in 1993, VHHs have become one of the most promising approaches
for the treatment and diagnosis of various diseases, including cancer, autoimmune diseases,
respiratory diseases, and blood systemic diseases. The first VHH-based drug Caplacizumab
was approved in 2018 for the treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and
thrombosis. In 2022, the first VHH-based CAR-T treatment Carvykti has been approved by
the FDA to treat multiple myeloma. Up until now, VHH alone as a therapeutical agent has
not been approved for anti-cancer treatments.
As the smallest known antibody fragment that can recognize antigen, the VHHs retain
high affinity and specificity, whilst having unique chemical and physical features compared
to conventional antibodies. The unique molecular structure of VHHs makes it possible
to bind some epitopes that conventional antibodies are not able to access, such as the
active structure in the middle of the protein cleft. These unique features may behave like
a ‘double-edged sword’ in the therapeutic application of VHHs. For example, the single
domain character of VHH makes almost every amino acid residue crucial for antigen-
antibody interaction increasing the difficulty of VHH humanization. Additionally, fast
blood clearance can reduce the toxicity of the treatment, but it may compromise treatment
efficacy as well. In addition, although the lack of Fc fragments minimize immunogenicity,
the absence of ADCC or CDC limits the application of VHHs in anti-cancer treatments,
which are mainly promoted by Fc fragments. Therefore, related technologies should be
applied in the VHHs development process to overcome these drawbacks of VHHs. In
addition, in preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of VHHs, the cancer models should
be chosen carefully, and the data should be interpreted with caution, since in some studies
VHH imaging agents recognizing human antigen were tested in human tumor xenografts in
mice, which cannot provide information on the binding of VHH in normal tissues of human
origin. Similarly, VHH with immune-modulating properties targeting human antigens
should be investigated in humanized mouse models.
7. Conclusions
According to the database of clinical trials investigating VHH-based anti-cancer agents,
most VHHs in ongoing clinical trials are still in their early stages. Most of these anti-cancer
targets cover PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA4, HER2, EGFR, and BCMA. The VHH studies gathered
in this review indicate that many promising novel VHH-based anti-cancer treatments and
diagnostic tools have been investigated. With the progressive understanding of cancer
biology, more potential anti-cancer targets have been identified. Together with straightfor-
ward selection methods, efficient and cost-effective expression, and purification techno-
logical processes, VHHs represent a promising opportunity in anti-cancer treatment and
cancer diagnosis.
