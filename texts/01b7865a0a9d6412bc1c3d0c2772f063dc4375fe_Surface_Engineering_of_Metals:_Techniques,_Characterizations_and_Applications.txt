1. Introduction
Surface engineering plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance and function-
ality of metallic materials across various industries. The ability to modify the surface
properties of metals has opened up new avenues for improving their mechanical strength,
wear resistance, corrosion protection, and biocompatibility [ 1,2]. Recent advancements in
surface engineering techniques and characterization methods have further propelled the
ﬁeld, leading to innovative applications and transformative outcomes.
Surface engineering techniques can be broadly categorized into physical and chemical
approaches. Physical techniques involve the application of heat or energy to modify the
surface, such as thermal spray coatings, physical vapor deposition (PVD), chemical vapor
deposition (CVD), and laser surface engineering. These techniques offer versatility in
tailoring surface properties, including hardness, adhesion, and surface texture, to meet
speciﬁc requirements. On the other hand, chemical techniques such as electroplating, elec-
troless plating, sol–gel coatings, and chemical etching provide opportunities for controlled

deposition and chemical modiﬁcation of the surface, enabling improvements in corrosion
resistance, biocompatibility, and functionalization [3–7].
To understand and evaluate the effectiveness of surface engineering processes, an
array of characterization methods is employed. Microstructural characterization techniques,
such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and
X-ray diffraction (XRD), enable the examination of surface morphology, crystallographic
structure, and phase composition. Surface topography analysis tools, such as atomic
force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and surface proﬁlometry,
allow for precise measurement and visualization of surface roughness, texture, and feature
dimensions. Additionally, mechanical and tribological characterization methods, including
hardness testing, wear and friction testing, and scratch and indentation testing, provide
insights into the mechanical behavior and performance of the engineered surfaces [8,9].
Recent advancements in surface engineering have brought about remarkable improve-
ments in the ﬁeld. Nanostructured coatings [ 10–12] have emerged as a prominent area of
research, with enhanced mechanical and tribological properties being achieved through
precise control over the microstructure and composition at the nanoscale. These coatings
exhibit exceptional hardness, wear resistance, and reduced friction, making them highly
desirable for various industrial applications.
Furthermore, surface modiﬁcation techniques have been developed to address the
challenges of corrosion protection. Corrosion-resistant coatings [ 13,14] and surface pas-
sivation methods [ 15,16] offer improved durability and an extended lifespan for metallic
components exposed to harsh environments. These advancements hold signiﬁcant po-
tential in industries such as automotive, aerospace, and marine, where corrosion-related
failures can have severe consequences.
Surface engineering has also made signiﬁcant contributions to the biomedical ﬁeld.
Bioactive coatings for implantable devices, such as orthopedic implants and dental pros-
thetics, promote osseointegration and reduce the risk of implant rejection [ 17,18]. Moreover,
antimicrobial surface treatments have been developed to combat infections in healthcare
settings, providing a crucial line of defense against microbial colonization on medical
devices and surfaces [19].
The energy sector has also witnessed the impact of surface engineering advancements.
Surface modiﬁcations have been employed to enhance the catalytic activity of materials for
efﬁcient energy-conversion processes. Additionally, coatings and surface functionalization
have been explored to improve the performance and durability of energy storage devices,
such as batteries [20] and fuel cells [21].
In the aerospace and defense sectors, surface engineering techniques are used to
enhance the performance and longevity of critical components subjected to extreme con-
ditions [ 22]. In the automotive sector, wear-resistant coatings and corrosion protection
technologies are vital for ensuring the reliability and safety of engine components and
automotive parts [ 23,24], while in the electronics and semiconductor industry, surface
modiﬁcations enable the fabrication of high-performance devices [25].
Despite the signiﬁcant advancements in surface engineering, several challenges remain.
The complexity of the surface engineering processes, the need for precise control over
deposition parameters, and the scalability of techniques for large-scale production are
areas that require further investigation and development. Additionally, the integration of
surface engineering with other manufacturing processes and the cost-effectiveness of these
techniques are important considerations for practical implementation.
Looking towards the future, we see that the emerging trends and technologies in
surface engineering hold great promise. The utilization of advanced computational mod-
eling and simulation techniques can aid in the design and optimization of engineered
surfaces with tailored properties. Furthermore, the exploration of novel materials, such
as graphene and other two-dimensional materials, opens up possibilities for developing
advanced coatings and functionalized surfaces with unique properties.Metals 2023 ,13, 1299 3 of 31

tionalization demonstrate the transformative potential of surface engineering. However,
challenges and opportunities lie ahead, and future research and development efforts will

of a metal coating onto a conductive  substrate  through an electrochemical  process. As de-
picted in Figure 5, the substrate  is immersed  in an electrolyte  solution containing  metal 
ions, and an electric current is applied to initiate the electrodeposition  of the desired metal.

non-electrochemical process that involves the deposition of a metal coating onto a substrate
without the need for an external power source. The coating is formed through a controlled
chemical reduction reaction. Electroless plating offers advantages such as uniform coating

3. Characterization Methods for Surface Engineering
Characterization plays a crucial role in evaluating the effectiveness and performance of
surface engineering techniques. By examining the microstructural, topographical, and me-
chanical properties of engineered surfaces, researchers can gain insights into the structure–
function relationship and make informed decisions for process optimization and material
selection [ 8]. This section discusses the key characterization methods used in the surface
engineering of metals.
3.1. Microstructural Characterization
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) : SEM is a widely used technique for microstruc-
tural analysis of surfaces. It provides high-resolution images of the surface morphology,
revealing details such as grain structure, porosity, and coating thickness. SEM utilizes a
focused electron beam to scan the surface, and the interaction of the beam with the sample
generates signals that are used to construct an image. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) can be coupled with SEM to analyze the elemental composition of the surface. The
integration of SEM and EDS offers a powerful toolset for surface engineering research. SEM
provides morphological information, aiding in evaluating surface treatment techniques and
understanding the relationship between microstructure and material properties. EDS com-
plements this by providing an elemental analysis, identifying impurities, assessing coating
quality, and optimizing surface engineering processes. Together, SEM and EDS enable re-
searchers to gain comprehensive insights into surface morphology, elemental composition,
and overall characteristics, driving advancements in materials science and technology.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) : TEM allows for a detailed examination of the
microstructure at the nanoscale. A thin sample is illuminated with a beam of electrons,
and the transmitted electrons are collected to form an image. TEM provides information
on the crystal structure, grain boundaries, and defects within the material. It is partic-
ularly useful for characterizing thin ﬁlms, nanoparticles, and interfaces. TEM provides
invaluable insights into the atomic-level characteristics of materials, facilitating a deeper
understanding of their properties and performance. It is particularly useful for analyz-
ing thin ﬁlms, enabling the precise examination of thickness, uniformity, and crystalline
structure. Additionally, TEM plays a signiﬁcant role in investigating nanoparticles and
interfaces, offering high-resolution imaging for studying size, shape, and internal structure.
Focused Ion Beam (FIB) technology complements TEM by enabling precise sample prepa-
ration, including cross-sectional imaging and in situ nanoscale modiﬁcation. FIB allows for
controlled milling, extraction of thin lamellae, and fabrication of nanostructures, enhancing
the capabilities of TEM analysis. The integration of TEM and FIB techniques offers a pow-
erful platform for materials’ characterization and manipulation, enabling advancements in
diverse ﬁelds of research and applications, such as materials science, nanotechnology, and
device fabrication.
X-ray Diffraction (XRD) : XRD is employed to analyze the crystallographic structure
and phase composition of materials. When a polycrystalline sample is exposed to X-ray
radiation, the diffraction pattern produced provides information about the crystal lattice
and the arrangement of atoms. XRD can identify the phases present in coatings or surface-
modiﬁed layers and assess their crystallinity. Through XRD analysis, researchers can
determine the types of crystal structures present in a material, as well as their relative
abundances. By comparing the obtained diffraction pattern with known crystallographic
databases, the speciﬁc phases within the sample can be identiﬁed. Furthermore, XRD can
provide insights into the quality of crystal growth and the presence of any structural defects
or strain in the material. In the context of coatings or surface modiﬁcation, XRD is highly
useful for characterizing the crystalline phases formed during the process. It can helpMetals 2023 ,13, 1299 10 of 31
determine the degree of phase transformation and assess the overall crystallinity of the
modiﬁed surface. This information is essential for understanding the structure–property
relationships and optimizing the performance of engineered surfaces.
3.2. Surface Topography Analysis
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) : AFM is a versatile technique that is used to analyze
surface topography at the nanoscale. It utilizes a sharp probe that scans the surface
and measures the forces between the probe tip and the sample. The tip’s movement is
tracked, generating a high-resolution topographic image of the surface. AFM can quantify
parameters such as roughness, surface features, and texture. Additionally, advanced modes
such as scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) and magnetic force microscopy (MFM)
can provide information about the surface potential and magnetic properties, respectively.
The versatility of AFM makes it a valuable tool for surface characterization in various
ﬁelds of research and industry. Its ability to visualize and measure surface features at the
nanoscale provides crucial information for understanding material properties, assessing
surface quality, and optimizing processes. With the integration of advanced modes such
as SKPM and MFM, AFM expands its capabilities to investigate electrical and magnetic
properties, broadening its application range.
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) : STM is a technique that provides atomic-level
imaging and analysis of surfaces. It involves scanning a sharp metallic probe tip over the
sample surface while maintaining a small tunneling current between the tip and the sample.
By monitoring the tip–sample distance, STM generates a three-dimensional image of the
surface with atomic resolution. STM is particularly useful for studying the surface defects,
atomic arrangements, and electronic properties of materials. The atomic-level imaging
capabilities of STM have revolutionized the ﬁeld of surface science. It has been instrumental
in advancing our understanding of surface phenomena, such as surface reconstructions,
surface diffusion, and surface reactions. Furthermore, STM has proven valuable in studying
the behavior of molecules and nanoscale devices on surfaces, facilitating the development
of molecular electronics and nanotechnology.
Surface Proﬁlometry : Surface proﬁlometry is a technique used to measure surface
roughness and evaluate the height variations of a sample. It employs a stylus or optical
methods to scan the surface and record the height proﬁle. Surface proﬁlometry provides
quantitative data on parameters such as the average roughness (R a), maximum height
(Rmax), and spatial wavelength features. The technique ﬁnds widespread applications in
quality control, surface characterization, and process optimization within the ﬁeld of sur-
face engineering. By quantifying surface roughness, proﬁlometry helps ensure the desired
quality and consistency of manufactured surfaces. It aids in evaluating the effectiveness of
surface treatments and coatings, enabling researchers and engineers to optimize processes
and enhance material performance. Surface proﬁlometry plays a crucial role in indus-
tries such as semiconductor manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and microelectronics,
where the precise control of surface properties is essential. A comparison of the different
characterization methods discussed above is presented in Table 3.Metals 2023 ,13, 1299 11 of 31

3.3. Mechanical and Tribological Characterization
Hardness Testing : Hardness testing measures the resistance of a material to indentation
or penetration. Common hardness tests include the Rockwell hardness test, Vickers hard-
ness test, and Brinell hardness test. These tests assess the material’s mechanical properties,
such as hardness, toughness, and elastic modulus, which are critical for evaluating the
wear resistance and durability of surface-engineered materials. There are several common
hardness tests employed in practice, including the Rockwell hardness test, Vickers hardness
test, and Brinell hardness test. Each test utilizes speciﬁc indentation techniques and mea-
surement parameters to determine the hardness of the material. By subjecting a material
to a controlled indentation or penetration, hardness testing enables the assessment of its
ability to withstand external forces and resist deformation. This information is particularlyMetals 2023 ,13, 1299 12 of 31
important in surface engineering, as it aids in selecting suitable materials and surface treat-
ments to enhance the wear resistance and longevity of components subjected to mechanical
stress. The results obtained from hardness testing can assist in optimizing material selection,
evaluating the effectiveness of surface engineering processes, and ensuring compliance
with industry standards and speciﬁcations.
Wear and Friction Testing : Wear and friction testing methods evaluate the tribological
performance of surface-engineered materials. Techniques such as pin-on-disk, ball-on-disk,
and reciprocating sliding tests are used to simulate real-world contact and sliding condi-
tions. These tests measure parameters such as wear rate, coefﬁcient of friction, and surface
damage. They provide valuable information about the effectiveness of surface engineer-
ing techniques in reducing wear, improving lubrication, and enhancing the tribological
properties of materials [ 56]. Through wear and friction testing, researchers can evaluate
the performance and durability of surface-engineered materials under various operating
conditions. These tests simulate the mechanical interactions and stresses that occur during
sliding or rubbing contact, allowing for a realistic assessment of the material’s resistance
to wear and the efﬁciency of lubrication. The measurements obtained from these tests
help in identifying the most suitable surface treatments, coatings, or lubricants to enhance
the tribological performance of materials in practical applications. By quantifying wear
rates, the coefﬁcient of friction, and surface damage, wear and friction testing enables
a comparative analysis of different materials and surface modiﬁcations. It aids in the
optimization of material selection and surface engineering processes to achieve improved
wear resistance, reduced friction, and extended service life.
Nanoscale friction measurement using friction force microscopy (FFM) is a powerful
technique that allows for the investigation and characterization of frictional behavior at
the nanoscale level. FFM employs a sharp probe tip, typically a cantilever with a sharp
tip, which is scanned across the surface of the sample of interest. As the tip interacts with
the sample, the lateral force or friction between the tip and the surface is measured [ 57].
By analyzing the lateral force signal, researchers can extract information about the fric-
tional properties, such as the friction coefﬁcient, adhesion, and surface interactions, at
the nanoscale.
When comparing nanoscale friction measurement using FFM to macroscale friction
measurement, it is important to recognize the fundamental differences in scale and contact
mechanics. At the nanoscale, the surface interactions and forces governing friction behavior
can differ signiﬁcantly from those at the macroscale. Nanoscale friction is inﬂuenced
by various factors, including atomic-level interactions, surface roughness, adhesion, and
lubrication effects. In contrast, macroscale friction is primarily inﬂuenced by factors such
as the normal force, surface roughness, and the nature of the sliding materials [ 56–58].
However, both nanoscale and macroscale friction measurements provide valuable insights
into the fundamental understanding of friction and play a crucial role in the development
of advanced materials, coatings, and lubricants for various applications. By studying
friction behavior at both scales, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding
of frictional phenomena and develop strategies to optimize tribological performance in
practical systems.
Scratch and Indentation Testing : Scratch and indentation tests are employed to assess the
hardness, adhesion, and deformation behavior of surface-engineered coatings or modiﬁed
layers. Techniques such as nanoindentation and microscratch testing involve applying
controlled loads and measuring the resulting deformation or damage. These tests can
determine critical properties such as the hardness, elastic modulus, adhesive strength, and
resistance to deformation, providing insights into the mechanical integrity and performance
of the engineered surfaces. Through scratch and indentation testing, researchers can assess
the response of surface-engineered coatings or modiﬁed layers to external forces. By
subjecting the material to controlled scratching or indenting, these tests provide quantitative
data on hardness, measuring the material’s resistance to deformation. Additionally, they
evaluate the adhesive strength of coatings or modiﬁed layers by assessing their ability toMetals 2023 ,13, 1299 13 of 31
withstand applied loads without delamination or failure. These tests play a crucial role
in characterizing the mechanical properties of surface-engineered materials. They aid in
optimizing coating processes, selecting suitable materials, and assessing the durability of
engineered surfaces under different operating conditions. The measurements obtained
from scratch and indentation testing help in determining the material’s ability to resist
wear, withstand mechanical stresses, and maintain its functional properties.
By employing these characterization methods, researchers can gain a comprehensive
understanding of the structural, topographical, and mechanical properties of surface-
engineered metals. These insights aid in the evaluation, optimization, and quality control
of surface engineering processes. Furthermore, the characterization data obtained from
these techniques help establish correlations between processing parameters, microstructure,
and functional properties, facilitating the development of improved surface engineering
strategies and materials.
The selection of characterization techniques depends on the speciﬁc objectives and
requirements of the surface engineering study. Each technique has its strengths and
limitations, and a combination of complementary techniques is often employed to obtain a
holistic characterization of the engineered surfaces.

or damage. Advanced heat treatment methods, such as induction hardening [ 69] and
laser surface hardening [ 70], have been investigated to achieve precise and localized
hardening, optimizing the mechanical properties of critical components. These techniques
help enhance the wear resistance and longevity of military equipment, ensuring reliable
performance during demanding operations [71].
Protective coatings have also been extensively studied to enhance the corrosion resis-
tance of military equipment. In harsh environments, such as marine or desert environments,

operational effectiveness of military equipment.
Specialized ﬁnishes have gained attention in surface engineering for military equip-
ment to meet speciﬁc operational requirements. These ﬁnishes include coatings with
low reﬂectivity, reduced infrared signatures, and improved adhesion for camouﬂage pur-
poses [ 73,74]. Recent advancements in materials and application techniques have allowed
for the development of coatings that provide enhanced stealth capabilities by reducing the
equipment’s visibility in different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. This can signiﬁ-
cantly improve the survivability and effectiveness of military assets in combat scenarios.
4.2. Automotive Sector
Wear-Resistant Coatings for Engine Components : In the automotive sector, surface en-
gineering plays a crucial role in improving the performance and lifespan of engine com-
ponents. Recent research and developments have focused on enhancing wear-resistant
coatings to minimize friction, reduce wear, and optimize fuel efﬁciency [75,76].
DLC coatings have emerged as a prominent solution for wear resistance in engine
components. DLC coatings exhibit a unique combination of properties, including high
hardness, low friction coefﬁcients, and excellent adhesion to substrates. Recent studies have
explored different variants of DLC coatings, such as amorphous hydrogenated DLC [ 77,78]
and tetrahedral amorphous carbon [ 79], to enhance their tribological performance. These
coatings have demonstrated remarkable resistance to abrasive wear, reducing friction losses
and improving the efﬁciency of internal combustion engines.
Additionally, research has focused on improving the adhesion and cohesion of wear-
resistant coatings to ensure their durability under high-stress conditions [ 80,81]. Techniques
such as surface pretreatments, interlayer materials, and optimized deposition processes
have been investigated to enhance the bonding strength between the coating and the
substrate [ 82–84]. For example, the use of intermediate layers such as titanium nitride
(TiN) or chromium nitride (CrN) has shown improved adhesion, leading to enhanced wear
resistance and an extended component lifespan [85–87].
Furthermore, the application of single crystal coatings has gained attention in recent
years [ 83]. Single crystal coatings offer superior mechanical properties compared to theirMetals 2023 ,13, 1299 15 of 31
polycrystalline counterparts, thanks to their high crystalline order and absence of grain
boundaries. They exhibit enhanced resistance to wear, improved adhesion, and reduced
friction, making them attractive for wear-resistant applications. The precise control of
crystallographic orientation in single crystal coatings allows researchers to tailor their
properties to speciﬁc applications and optimize their performance under demanding
operating conditions.
Corrosion Protection for Automotive Parts : Corrosion is a signiﬁcant concern in the
automotive industry, impacting the longevity and aesthetics of vehicles. Surface engi-
neering techniques have been instrumental in providing effective corrosion protection to
automotive parts, ensuring their durability in diverse environments.
Zinc–nickel alloy coatings have gained attention as a corrosion-resistant solution for
automotive components [ 88]. Recent research has focused on optimizing the composition
and deposition parameters of these coatings to enhance their corrosion resistance and
adhesion. Zinc–nickel coatings offer superior protection against corrosion, even in harsh
conditions such as exposure to road salts or acidic environments [ 89,90]. Furthermore,
advancements in electrodeposition techniques, such as pulse plating [ 91,92] or electrodepo-
sition from ionic liquids [ 93], have contributed to the development of high-performance
zinc–nickel alloy coatings with improved uniformity and enhanced corrosion resistance.

automotive parts. For instance, researchers have investigated the application of an electro-
plating bath containing trivalent chromium ions for chromium coatings. This particular
bath, utilizing trivalent chromium ions, offers an eco-friendly alternative to the traditional
hexavalent chromium bath [ 94,95]. Trivalent chromium coatings provide excellent corro-
sion resistance, adhesion, and aesthetic appeal, while reducing the environmental impact
associated with traditional chromium plating processes. Additionally, nanocomposite coat-
ings, incorporating nanoparticles or organic inhibitors, have been investigated to enhance
the corrosion protection of automotive parts further [96,97].
4.3. Electronics and Semiconductor Industry

tronic devices [ 99]. Plasma etching and deposition techniques allow for the precise control
of surface characteristics, such as surface roughness, wettability, and chemical composition.
Plasma treatment can be used to remove contaminants, activate surfaces for better adhesion,
or modify surface energy to improve the wetting behavior of coatings or adhesives [ 100].
Recent studies have investigated plasma treatments using different gas compositions and
process parameters to tailor the surface properties of electronic components for speciﬁc
applications. For example, plasma surface modiﬁcation has been employed to enhance the
adhesion of wire bonding and soldering materials to electronic substrates, improving the
reliability of interconnections [100–102].
Chemical treatments are another important aspect of surface engineering for electronic
devices. Chemical processes, such as etching, cleaning, and passivation, are utilized
to remove impurities, improve surface uniformity, and enhance the chemical stability
of components. Recent research has focused on developing environmentally friendly
chemical treatments that minimize the use of hazardous substances while achieving high-
performance surface modiﬁcations. For instance, innovative solutions based on water-based
chemistries or environmentally benign etchants have been explored to replace traditional
chemical treatments involving toxic chemicals. These advancements contribute to the
sustainable manufacturing of electronic devices [103–105].Metals 2023 ,13, 1299 16 of 31
Surface passivation is a critical surface modiﬁcation technique to protect electronic
components from moisture and environmental factors [ 105]. Passivation layers—typically
thin ﬁlms or coatings—are applied to electronic devices to prevent the degradation of their
electrical performance due to moisture absorption or corrosion. Recent developments have
focused on the development of passivation materials with improved barrier properties,
such as organosilanes or conformal atomic layer deposition coatings [ 106,107]. These
materials provide an effective moisture barrier, preventing the penetration of water vapor
into sensitive electronic components and ensuring their long-term reliability.
Thin Film Coatings for Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMSs) : Surface engineering
plays a vital role in the fabrication of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs) used in
electronic and sensor applications. Thin ﬁlm coatings are deposited onto MEMS devices
to provide insulation, protection against environmental factors, and mechanical stability,
thereby enabling the development of highly sensitive and reliable MEMS devices [108].
Silicon dioxide (SiO 2) and silicon nitride (SiN x) are commonly used as thin ﬁlm coat-
ings in MEMS. SiO 2ﬁlms offer excellent electrical insulation, high-temperature stability,
and chemical resistance, making them suitable for applications requiring electrical isolation
or protection against harsh environments. SiN xcoatings provide mechanical stability,
low stress, and enhanced barrier properties, ensuring the protection of MEMS structures
from moisture, chemical attack, and particle contamination. Recent research has focused

niques to enhance the performance and reliability of SiO 2and SiN xcoatings for MEMS
applications [109,110].
Metal ﬁlms have also been extensively studied as thin ﬁlm coatings for MEMS devices.
Metals such as aluminum, gold, and titanium are deposited onto MEMS structures to pro-
vide electrical conductivity, bonding pads, or optical reﬂectivity. Recent advancements have

antifouling coatings on electronic surfaces has gained attention to improve the performance
and longevity of devices in demanding environments. By incorporating hydrophobic
or oleophobic properties into the surface coatings, researchers aim to prevent the accu-
mulation of dust, oils, or contaminants, reducing the need for frequent cleaning and
maintenance [116].
Moreover, surface modiﬁcations have been explored to enable novel functionalities
in electronic devices. For instance, surface patterning techniques, such as nanoimprint
lithography or self-assembly of nanoparticles, have been utilized to create micro- or nanos-
tructures with speciﬁc optical, electrical, or mechanical properties. These patterned surfaces
can be employed in applications such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), optical ﬁlters, or
microﬂuidic devices, where precise control over surface properties is essential for device
performance [117,118].
Nanoimprint lithography enables the replication of nanoscale patterns by imprinting
a resist material onto a substrate by using a master template. This technique allows the
creation of nanostructures with precise dimensions, shapes, and arrangements, offering
opportunities to tailor the optical and electrical properties of surfaces [ 117]. By controlling
the size, shape, and spacing of nanostructures, nanoimprint lithography enables the manip-
ulation of light at the nanoscale, leading to enhanced light extraction efﬁciency in LEDs,
improved light–matter interactions in sensors, and optimized optical ﬁlters with tailored
spectral characteristics.
The self-assembly of nanoparticles is another approach to fabricate nanostructured
coatings. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of nanoparticles, such as their size, shape,Metals 2023 ,13, 1299 17 of 31
and surface chemistry, researchers can engineer surfaces with desired functionalities [ 118].
The self-assembly process allows nanoparticles to organize into well-deﬁned patterns or
structures, creating surfaces with unique optical, electrical, or mechanical properties. These
nanostructured coatings have been used in various applications, including plasmonic de-
vices, energy harvesting systems, and biosensors, where surface properties at the nanoscale
play a crucial role in achieving desired functionality.
The precise control and manipulation of surface properties through surface patterning
techniques in nanostructured coatings have opened up new avenues for innovation and ad-
vancement in electronic devices. By tailoring the optical, electrical, and mechanical properties
of surfaces at the nanoscale, researchers can create functional coatings that offer improved
device performance, enhanced efficiency , and new possibilities for emerging technologies.
4.4. Biomedical and Healthcare Sector
Surface Engineering for Medical Implants : Surface engineering techniques have signiﬁ-
cantly advanced the ﬁeld of medical implants, addressing the critical need for biocompati-
bility and successful integration within the human body. Recent research and developments
have focused on enhancing the surface properties of implants to promote osseointegration,
reduce the risk of rejection, and improve patient outcomes [119,120].
Bioactive coatings have been at the forefront of surface engineering for medical im-
plants. Hydroxyapatite (HA), a biocompatible material that closely resembles the mineral
component of natural bone, has been widely used as a coating to promote bone integration.
HA coatings provide a favorable surface for the attachment and proliferation of bone cells,
facilitating the formation of a strong bond between the implant and the surrounding bone
tissue [ 119]. Recent studies have explored the use of novel methods, such as electrochemical
deposition or biomimetic approaches, to improve the adherence, uniformity, and bioactivity
of HA coatings on implant surfaces [121,122].
In addition to HA, biocompatible polymers have also been utilized as coatings for
medical implants. These polymers, such as polyethylene glycol and polycaprolactone,
can be applied to implant surfaces to reduce inﬂammation, minimize the foreign body
response, and enhance tissue integration. Researchers have focused on optimizing the
surface chemistry and topography of these polymer coatings to facilitate cellular adhesion,
improve biocompatibility, and promote tissue regeneration around the implant [119,123].
Surface modiﬁcations beyond coatings have also been explored in recent years. Nanos-
tructured surfaces, created through techniques such as nanoimprinting or nanotexturing,
have shown promising results in promoting cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.
Nanostructures mimic the natural extracellular matrix, providing cues that guide cellular
behavior and tissue formation. Furthermore, functional groups’ immobilization, such as the
introduction of peptide sequences or growth factors onto implant surfaces, can modulate

ing organic pollutants and eliminating bacteria on surfaces when activated by UV light.
Similarly, researchers have explored the incorporation of antifouling properties into antimi-
crobial coatings, reducing the attachment of proteins, bioﬁlms, and other contaminants on
surfaces [131].
To ensure the efﬁcacy and durability of antimicrobial coatings in healthcare settings,
recent studies have focused on optimizing coating deposition methods, surface roughness,
and release kinetics of antimicrobial agents. Techniques such as plasma-enhanced chemical
vapor deposition, electrochemical deposition, or layer-by-layer assembly have been em-
ployed to achieve uniform and conformal coatings with controlled antimicrobial properties.
Furthermore, strategies for sustained release of antimicrobial agents from coatings have
been investigated, including encapsulation within nanoparticles or incorporating them into
biodegradable polymers [132,133].
The application of antimicrobial coatings in healthcare settings extends beyond med-
ical devices and equipment. High-touch surfaces in hospitals, such as door handles,
handrails, or bed rails, are also targeted to minimize the transmission of pathogens. Recent
developments have explored the use of durable antimicrobial coatings that withstand

4.5. Energy Applications
Surface Modiﬁcations for Enhanced Catalytic Activity : Surface engineering techniques
have signiﬁcantly contributed to improving the catalytic activity of metal surfaces, enabling
advancements in various energy-related applications. Recent research has focused on
tailoring the surface properties of catalysts to enhance their catalytic performance and
selectivity [134].
One approach involves controlling the surface roughness of catalysts. The manipu-
lation of surface morphology at the nanoscale or through the introduction of hierarchical
structures can signiﬁcantly impact catalytic activity. Increased surface roughness provides
a larger active surface area, improves reactant adsorption, and facilitates the diffusion of
reactant molecules, resulting in enhanced catalytic efﬁciency. Additionally, surface func-
tionalization through the introduction of speciﬁc chemical groups or functional ligands can
alter the electronic structure of the catalyst surface, inﬂuencing its catalytic activity and
selectivity [135,136].
Another important aspect of surface engineering in catalysis involves the creation of
bimetallic or alloyed structures. By combining two or more metals with different catalytic
properties, researchers can tune the surface composition and electronic structure to enhance
catalytic performance. Bimetallic catalysts often exhibit synergistic effects, where the
interaction between the two metals leads to improved catalytic activity, selectivity, andMetals 2023 ,13, 1299 19 of 31
stability. These catalysts have been extensively explored in processes such as hydrogen
production [137], carbon dioxide conversion [138], and selective oxidation reactions [139].
Recent developments in surface engineering for catalysis have also focused on the
design of catalyst supports and the introduction of surface modiﬁers. Catalyst supports
with high surface areas and tailored pore structures can enhance mass transport and
improve the accessibility of reactants to active sites. Surface modiﬁers, such as oxides
or molecular coatings, can provide additional functionalities, such as improved stability,
selectivity, or resistance to catalyst deactivation [140].
These surface modiﬁcations and advancements in catalysis have signiﬁcant implica-
tions for the development of sustainable energy technologies. For instance, in the ﬁeld of
hydrogen production, efﬁcient catalysts are essential for processes such as water splitting
or steam reforming. By optimizing the surface properties of catalysts, researchers aim to
enhance the efﬁciency, reduce energy consumption, and improve the overall sustainability
of hydrogen production methods [141].

been extensively studied to enhance battery performance. These coatings serve multiple
purposes, including improving the stability of electrode materials during cycling, inhibiting
undesired side reactions, and enhancing ion and electron transport within the battery. For
example, coating electrode materials with protective layers, such as oxides or polymers,
can prevent direct contact between the electrode and electrolyte, reducing side reactions
and enhancing the stability of the battery. Furthermore, surface modiﬁcations can enhance
the interfacial compatibility between different components of the battery, improving charge
transfer and cyclability [142,144].
Similarly, in solar cell technologies, surface engineering has been utilized to optimize
light absorption, charge transport, and device efﬁciency. Surface texturing techniques, such
as nanostructuring or surface patterning, can effectively trap and scatter light within the
solar cell, increasing the path length of photons and enhancing absorption [ 145]. Addi-
tionally, surface modiﬁcations with anti-reﬂection coatings can reduce light reﬂection at
the cell surface, improving light absorption and overall device performance [ 146]. Surface
passivation techniques have also been employed to reduce surface recombination losses,
enhancing charge extraction and maximizing the efﬁciency of solar cells [147].
Furthermore, surface engineering techniques are being explored to address challenges
in emerging energy storage and conversion technologies. For instance, in the ﬁeld of
electrochemical energy storage, such as supercapacitors [ 148] and metal–air batteries [ 149],
surface modiﬁcations are being investigated to enhance the surface area, ion transport ki-
netics, and stability of electrode materials. The use of advanced surface coatings, nanoscale
