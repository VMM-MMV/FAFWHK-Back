ABSTRACT
Purpose  Despite to high burden of road traffic injuries 
(R
TIs), the RTI epidemiology has received less attention 
with rare investments on robust population cohorts. The 
PERSIAN Traffic Safety and Health Cohort (PTSHC) was designed to assess the potential causal relationships between human factors and RTI mortality, injuries, severity of the injury, hospitalised injury, violation of traffic law as well as offer the strongest scientific evidence.Participants
 The precrash cohort stud
y is carried out 
in four cities of Tabriz, Jolfa, Shabestar and Osku in East Azerbaijan province located in northwest Iran. The participants were people who sampled among the general population. The cluster sampling method was used to enrol the households in this study. The PTSHC encompasses a wide and comprehensive range and types of data. These include not only the common cohort data collections such as medical examination measures, previous medical history, bio assays and behavioural assessments but also includes data obtained using advanced novel technologies, for example, electronic travel monitoring, driving simulation and neuro-
 psycho-
 physiologic labora
tory 
assessments specifically developed for traffic health field.Findings to date
 A total of 7200 participants a
ged 14 
years and above were enrolled at baseline, nearly half of them being men. The mean age of participants was 39.2 (SD=19.9) years. The majority of participants (55.4%) belonged to the age group of 30–56 years. Currently, approximately 1
 200
 000 person-
 measurements ha
ve been 
collected.Future plans
 PSTHC will be used to determine the 
human-
 rela
ted risk factors by adjusting for the vehicle and 
land-
 use-
 rela
ted factors. Therefore, a lot of crashes can 
be prevented using effective interventions. Although this cohort provides valuable data, it is planned to increase its size to achieve the highest level of evidence with higher generalisability. Also, according to the national agreement this cohort is going to be extended to several geographical regions in second decade.
INTRODUCTION
Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are one of the major health concerns and causes of mortality especially in low and middle-
 income 
coun-
tries (LMICs).1 2 Developed countries with 
high motorisation have the lowest rate of road traffic crashes (RTCs) with less than 50 per 1000 people.
3 RTIs account for 
41.2
 million 
years of healthy life lost, and 90% 
of disability-
 adjusted life years in LMICs.4 5 
The global average deaths from RTCs as part of intentional and unintentional injures are about 24%, however, in Iran, it is more than 50%. According to the 2018 Global Status Report on Road Safety, the estimated rate of road traffic deaths in Iran was 20.5 per 100 0000 people. Also, the number of deaths by RTCs in the world is three people for every ten thousand cars, while it is 33 people for every ten thousand vehicles in Iran.
6 RTIs 
are the eighth leading cause of death world-wide, but in Iran, they are the second leading cause of death and are accounted for 80 000 major traumas yearly.
7 8 RTCs and RTIs cause 
serious economic loss approximately 1%–2% STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒The PERSIAN Traffic Safety and Health Cohort is the 
first population-
 based long-
 term traffic cohort in 
Eastern Mediterranean region.
 ⇒Other than human-  rela ted assessments, which are 
robustly evaluated, this cohort also measures and controls for the effects of vehicle safety, vehicle use and land-
 use in traffic injur
y causality network.
 ⇒This study could be an example of applying the con-vergence of science and advanced technologies in field of health research.
 ⇒A total of 7200 participants have been enrolled at the first phase, ensuring 1

 ⇒Overall, follow-  ups are to be run ever y 5 years; 
however, yearly follow-
 ups will be done for cohort 
outcomes. on December 21, 2024 by guest. Protected by copyright. http://bmjopen.bmj.com/ BMJ Open: first published as 10.1136/bmjopen-2023-080720 on 12 February 2024. Downloaded from 2

of Gross National Product in high-  income countries and 
6%–7% 
in Iran.9 Furthermore, it is estimated that RTIs 
would cost the world economy US$1.8
 trillion from 2015 
to 2030.10According to the definition of European Union and 
the International Transport, an RTCs is any accident 
involving at least one road vehicle in motion on a public road or private road to which the public has right of access, resulting in at least one injured or killed person.
11 The risk factors related to RTCs are 
classified into three main factors, including human factors, road-
 r
elated factors and vehicle-  r
elated 
factors. Human factors are the most common risk factors involved in RTCs.
12 13
Although numerous studies have been conducted in 
the field of RTIs, there is no significant progress and it still remains one of the most serious public health problems in Iran.
14–16 Therefore, one of the main 
priorities of the government is to obtain substantial evidence to improve traffic safety, reduce the burden of injuries and their various consequences. For this purpose, a comprehensive scientific study is required to assess the relationship between human factors and

Prospective population-  based cohort studies are a 
fundamental design in epidemiological studies. They cover a wide range of research questions and assess the association 
among various variables individually, and in 
combination.18
Thus, to get a more robust inference about the 
causality of RTCs, the PERSIAN Traffic Safety and Health Cohort (PTSHC) study was established in 2019, in Iran. The PTSHC has two separate parts; the population-
 b
ased cohort for precrash and the 
registered-  b
ased cohort for postcrash. The post -
crash cohort data are presented in a related article.19 
Other than human-  r
elated assessments which are 
robustly evaluated, precrash PTSHC also measures and controls for the effects of vehicle safety, vehicle use and land-
 u
se in traffic injury causality network. 
Furthermore, considering that this cohort is a house -
hold based, it provides an opportunity to examine the status of family aggregation in various traffic issues, including high-
 r
isk behaviour.
In order to respond to this major public health 
problem, the prospective precrash cohort study was designed for 30 years and is financially supported nationally and locally. This study has national funding from Ministry of Health and Medical Education and local funding from the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Moreover, this cohort study is systematically supported by the RTI Research Center (RTIRC) a centre of excellence specialised research centre on RTI prevention. Regarding this, study is the first priority of the RTIRC, the research centre has invested signifi -
cantly in the field of human resources and equipment.
COHORT DESCRIPTION
The precrash cohort study is a population-
 based prospec
-
tive study that is part of the PERSIAN cohort and is carried out in four cities of Tabriz, Jolfa, Shabestar and 
Osku in East Azerbaijan province located in northwest Iran (1
 
600
 
000 residents).
This cohort study is systematically supported by 
the RTIRC (hereinafter referred to as the Centre), TBZMED. The Centre has a key intersectoral national role in RTI
S prevention and road safety promotion 
as well as good capacity and experience at regional and international levels. This Centre is equipped with a Health and Traffic Safety Clinic and a labora -
tory to examine physical/mental health and driving behavioural performance.
Study participants and data collection
The participants in the prospective precrash cohort study were people who were sampled among the general population. The cluster sampling method was used to determine the households in this study. At first, the source population was categorised into three strata in term of socioeconomic status according to the place of residence. Then 25 clusters were chosen from within the strata. Next, 20 households from each cluster were selected to participate in a study using convenience sampling. The estimated sample size is 10
 0
00 households. Until now, a number of 7200 
subjects have been included. Also, approximately 1
 2
20 0
00 person measurements have been collected. 
The sample size of this study will be grown up over time due to the openness of the cohort.
Trained interviewers do data collection. The inter -
viewers go door to door with the determined house-holds to explain the study objectives face-
 to-
 face and 
obtain their informed consent. The face-
 to-
 face method 
is an effective method to improve the participation of Iranian families into the study
. If the individuals agree 
to participate, recruitment and enrolment occur and the general background information about the household is completed. The reasons for participation refusal are recorded if declared.Table 1  The mean scor e of some assessments including of Kessler, SAPAS, GHQ according to age groups and sex

After that, the other questionnaires are given to the 
representative of each family and it is requested that 
all people over 14 years of age in the family complete them. Then, the completed questionnaires receive by coordinating and referring again. After that, all participants are contacted by phone and invited to attend RTIRC. Next, the specified measurements in the Traffic and Health Clinic, and Traffic Health and Behavioral Laboratory are performed. Later, the subsamples of participants are invited for selected specialty assessments such as Vienna Test System (VTS) and Electronic Travel Behavioural Monitoring. The inclusion criteria were comprised of the provision of informed consent and enrolment at baseline. The exclusion criteria comprise having no phone number for contact and follow-
 u
p and deaths, migration 
during the follow-  u
p period or refusal to participate.
Cohort online systemBecause multiple stakeholders were involved in the traffic cohort project and in order to facilitate data transfer among them, we decided to use an open-
 
s
ource programming approach for developing data -
bases, user interfaces and middleware. We used Structured Query Language (SQL) databases and Java platforms for the backend, HTML and JavaScript programming languages for frontend user interfaces. The whole platform was designed using Model-
 V
iew- 
C
ontroller architecture. That approach makes it 
possible for quick expansion of the cohort system if a need arises and facilitates its integration with other registry systems housed inside other organisations where they were using heterogeneous internal systems for data collection, storage and processing. Protecting data against unauthorised access was the highest priority in designing the cohort registry system.
Follow-ups
The prospective precrash cohort is planned to follow-
 up 
with participants for at least 30 years. The outcomes of this study are incidence of the crash, injur
y, severity of the 
injury, hospitalised injury and deaths. The first follow-
 up 
in this open prospective cohort will begin after 1 year
, and 
then follow-
 ups will be done ever
y 5 years (figure
 
1).Quality controlsTo ensure that all participants are enrolled in the study according to defined protocol, as well as to deci -
sion make based on valid and reliable data, quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) have been implemented by central and local QA/QC teams. QC involves three types of assessments: completeness, timeliness and correctness. Completeness and timeli -
ness refer to the percentage of completion of ques -
tion in the questionnaires by the participants and data collection according to the schedule, respectively. For assessing correctness, three types of evaluations were conducted: control random check, validity check and cross-
 
check.
Risk factors and outcomes assessmentThe measurements in this study are carried out in three main parts: the measurements for the human factor, the measurements for land-
 u
se and vehicle 
factors. The outcomes of this study are defined by the occurrence of the crash and its related injuries. The defined exposures in this study are human factors, including physical health, mental health, clinic exam -
ination, psychiatric clinic examination and preclinical examination.
The land-
 use 
and vehicle-
 related 
factors (include of 
traffic laboratory tests, vehicle clinic tests and road-
 related 
tests) are measured as predictor variables. V
arious tools 
are being used from previous studies or are designed and validated through the project. Figure
 
2 provides an 
overview of the measures that are used in this cohort study. Each part of the assessment and data collection is explained as follows:
Household survey
In household-
 level measurements, the general back
-
ground information about age, sex, job, literacy and insurance situation of the family members is gathered. Moreover, the socioeconomic status of the household is assessed using the short versions of the SESIran question-naire, which was developed and validated in Persian by Sadeghi-
 
Bazargani et al20 Measurements are performed 
by trained interviewers who visit respondents at home. On average, this interview takes 40
 min to complete. T

obtain additional data, respondents are asked to fill out 
a written questionnaire separately, which is left at the respondent’s home after the visit.
In-person survey
In an in-
 person sur
vey, the information is gathered in 
three main parts; physical health, mental health, and safety behaviour.
Physical health assessment
In physical health assessment, the main parameters are scheduled such as general health status using the stan-dardised and validated General Health Questionnaire,
21 
sleep quality by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index,22 quality 
of life using a Persian version of WHO quality of life questioner (WHOQOL),
23 visual screening, hearing 
screening. Psychometric properties of the questioners available in the published studies. Moreover, the exam-ination of diabetes, stroke diseases and brain haemor -
rhage are done. After the consent of the participants, the participants are invited to an in-
 person visit at the study 
site, and a physical examination is per
formed by a quali-
fied general practitioner.
Mental health assessment
The mental health status of participants is examined by a psychiatrist through a Structured Clinical Inter -
view for DSM Disorder in terms of several disorders. The main parameters of mental health are sched-uled including adult deficit/hyperactivity disorder by CONNERS’ Screening Scale, Standardized Assessment of Personality, Personality inventory for DSM-
 5
 brief 
form, Psychological Distress assessment using Kessler, major depressive disorder, mood disorder, Post trau-matic stress disorder, Traffic psychological assessment using VTS, anxiety disorder, adaptive disorder, alcohol or drug use, schizophrenia or psychosis disorder, personality disorder. The participants are invited to an in-
 p
erson visit at the study site and after they give 
consent, they are offered counselling with a qualified psychiatrist.
Behavioural assessment
Assessing the traffic behaviour of a person is considered according to his/her role in the traffic environment. In behavioural assessment, the main parameters are sched-uled such as traffic behaviours by Pedestrian Behavior Questionnaire, Motorcycle Riding Behavior Question-naire, Persian version of Manchester driving behaviour, reaction time, collision avoidance behaviour, total brake reaction time, driver performance, driver distance trav-elled, pedestrian walking travelled, travel pattern, compli-ance with traffic laws and virtual driving assessment on a driving simulator.
Vehicle assessment
The measurements related to vehicles are classified into five categories:1.
 V
ehicle characteristics including vehicle model, type 
and vehicle age.
2.
 V
ehicle safety specifications at the production lev-
el such as airbags, the number of airbags, Electronic Brake-
 force Distribution, Electronic Stability Pro
-
gramme, etc.
3.
 Measurements related to road use and vehicle use such as vehicle kilometres travelled.
4.
 Information obtained from machine data includes speed, 
acceleration, location, etc (machine data is 
digital information created by the activity of comput-ers, mobile phones, embedded systems and other net-worked devices that are installed in a vehicle).
Patient and public involvementPatients and/or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.
STUDIES AND FINDINGS TO DATE
From late 2019 up to now, 7200 people have been recruited in this study. Of them, 51.14% (3546 people) were men. The mean age of participants was 39.23 (SD=19.96) years. The majority of participants (55.41%) belong to the age group of 30–56 years. The data of this study will be published in different articles. The selected summary results of this study are shown in table
 1.
One of the main goals of this cohort is to develop health 
and traffic knowledge. Therefore, a number 
of master’s 
and PhD theses and research projects are part of this cohort study. The details of theses and projects that have been enrolled up to this time are presented in table
 
2.
This study was not only effective in determining the 
pattern of risk factors affecting the occurrence of acci-dents but also able to determine the necessary interven-tions in prevention and provide practical programmes and solutions to reduce the risk of accidents and traffic violations and their subsequent consequences. Also, this study produced evidence-
 based data that is a basis for 
policymaking for planners in the field of traffic accident prevention.
T
he studies conducted in the field of traffic are only 
on the accidents and no study in the current condi -
tions has been able to measure the role of vehicles and the injuries caused by them in the occurrence of acci -
dents, which the cohort study has fully investigated.
