Abstract: Biodegradable polymers play a signiﬁcant role in medical applications, especially internal
devices because they can be broken down and absorbed into the body without producing harmful
degradation products. In this study, biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA)-polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA)-based nanocomposites with various PHA and nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) contents were
prepared using solution casting method. Mechanical properties, microstructure, thermal stability,
thermal properties, and in vitro degradation of the PLA-PHA-based composites were investigated.
PLA-20PHA/5nHAp was shown to give the desired properties so it was selected to investigate
electrospinnability at different applied high voltages. PLA-20PHA/5nHAp composite shows the
highest improvement of tensile strength at 36.6 0.7 MPa, while PLA-20PHA/10nHAp composite
shows the highest thermal stability and in vitro degradation at 7.55% of weight loss after 56 days
of immersion in PBS solution. The addition of PHA in PLA-PHA-based nanocomposites improved
elongation at break, compared to the composite without PHA. PLA-20PHA/5nHAp solution was
successfully fabricated into ﬁbers by electrospinning. All obtained ﬁbers showed smooth and
continuous ﬁbers without beads with diameters of 3.7 0.9, 3.5 1.2, and 2.1 0.7m at applied
high voltages of 15, 20, and 25 kV , respectively.

1. Introduction
The circular economy (CE) has gained attention worldwide. The focus is on balance
between the economy, environment, and society, especially recycling and the use of re-
newable technologies and materials [ 1]. Nowadays, composite materials are widely used
in a variety of industrial sectors, resulting in a signiﬁcant accumulation of plastic waste
in the environment. Plastic composites require end-of-life (EOL) treatments because they
cannot be easily disposed of. So, there are various study works attempting to investigate
recycling and reusing techniques for plastics and their composite materials [ 2,3]. On the
other hand, the use of biopolymer composites does not necessitate the disposal process
because they can be decomposed of by themselves. Therefore, the development of materials
from renewable resources is receiving attention from many researchers [4–9].
Biopolymers derived from renewable resources such as polylactic acid (PLA), poly-
hydroxyalkanoate (PHA), and thermoplastic starch (TPS) are a popular alternative to
traditional petroleum-based plastics in several applications [ 10]. Since their advantageous
Polymers 2023 ,15, 1261. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15051261 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymersPolymers 2023 ,15, 1261 2 of 15
characteristics are renewability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, they have been
mostly used for packaging [11,12].
PLA is made from agricultural raw materials such as fermented plant starch. PLA
degrades environmentally in two stages. First, high molecular weight polyester chains
are hydrolyzed into oligomers, and then the oligomers are degraded into water, carbon
dioxide, and humus [ 13]. However, PLA has limitations such as its brittleness and low
heat resistance [ 14]. Various PLA composites with different ﬁllers have been developed to
overcome these drawbacks [15].
PHA is synthesized from bacteria (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) that have
more than 75 different genera [ 13]. PHA has biocompatibility, renewability, and biodegrad-
ability, but their homopolymers are brittle, with a high degree of crystallinity and narrow
processability window. However, the improved PHA was used in biomedical, packaging,
and agricultural plastic applications [16].
Although PLA and PHA are often used in biodegradable ap plications to ease environ-
mental problems, some weak properties such as low mechanical properties, low thermal
resistance, fragility, and low processability limit their performance. Thus, they have to
blend with each other or/and be incorporated with nanoparticles for composite materials
to improve their properties and performance [ 4,11,17–23]. Zhang and Thomas [ 17] reported
that PLA blended with polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) can improve tensile strength due to the
reinforcement effect of PHB small particles.
In the last decade, nanoﬁllers were one of the choices to overcome the drawbacks of
PLA and PHA. Inorganic nanoﬁller such as nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) has received
attention from many researchers. Nejati et al. [ 24] have synthesized nHAp/PLA composite
scaffolds for bone tissue engineering. They found that nHAp can improve the elastic mod-
ulus and compressive strength of their composites. The elastic modulus and compressive
strength of composites increased up to 14.9 and 8.67 MPa while that of pure PLLA increased
up to 2.40 and 1.79 MPa, respectively. Liu et al. [ 22] have prepared PLA/nHAp composite
scaffold by phase separation method. They found that nHAp can improve the thermal
decomposition temperature of the composite and its hydrophilicity.
Tissue engineering refers to the attempt to create functional human tissue from cells in
a laboratory. Its ultimate goal is to be a cure by repairing or replacing tissues and organs
due to disease, traumatic injury, genetic errors, etc. There are four important factors that
tissue engineering relies on: 1. the right cells to do the jobs, 2. the right environment such as
a scaffold to support the cells, 3. the right biomolecules (growth factors), and 4. mechanical
environment to inﬂuence the development of the cells [ 25]. Scaffolds play an important
role in the cell growth. Generally, they are biocompatible and biodegradable porous
structures. The scaffold requirements are biocompatibility, biodegradability, mechanical
properties, scaffold architecture, and manufacturing technology [ 26]. So, the characteristics
of biopolymers meet the requirement for scaffold development and suitable for human
use. There are many research studies which developed scaffolds and medical devices from
biopolymer composites for tissue engineering and biomedical applications. Fang et al. [ 27]
developed electrospun ﬁber scaffolds from polycaprolactone (PCL), PLA, and HAp for
osteoblast-like cells. Kara et al. [ 28] developed nanoﬁbrous composite scaffolds from
ﬁsh scale/poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) for bone regeneration.
Senatov et al. [ 29] developed highly porous scaffolds from PHB and HAp for small bone
defects replacement in the non-load-bearing parts. Prasad et al. [ 30] developed bioﬁlms
from PLA incorporated with HAp for use as internal ﬁxation. Promnil et al. [ 31] developed
nanoﬁbrous scaffold from PLA and silk ﬁbroin for meniscus tissue engineering.
The functional biomaterials that are entirely derived from natural resources were
expected to study and fabricate. In our previous work [ 9], nHAp powder was successfully
prepared from ﬁsh scales. In this study, we focused on the development of PLA-PHA-based
nanocomposites ﬁlled with nHAp. Effects of PHA and nHAp contents on the mechanical
properties, thermal properties, and biodegradability of the composites were studied. To
study the effect of nHAp contents and PHA contents on PLA-PHA/nHAp composites,Polymers 2023 ,15, 1261 3 of 15
PLA-20PHA-based nanocomposite ﬁlled with 0, 2.5, 5, and 10 phr of nHAp and PLA-
PHA/5nHAp-based nanocomposite ﬁlled with 5, 10, and 20 phr of PHA were prepared by
solution casting method. The mechanical properties of the composites including Young’s
modulus, tensile strength, and % elongation at break were investigated by tensile test-
ing. The thermal stability and thermal properties of the composites were investigated by
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry analysis (DSC).
Furthermore, the biodegradability of the composites was studied using in vitro degrada-
tion, which determines biodegradability by soaking the sample in phosphate buffered
solution (PBS). In addition, the composites that gave the desired properties was selected to
investigate electrospinnability at different applied high voltages.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Preparation of PLA-PHA/nHAp Composite Films
Nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAp) powder from ﬁsh scales with crystallite size of 19.41
nm was prepared in-house, as described in [ 9]. Brieﬂy, ﬁsh scales were deproteinized
by hydrochloric acid and treated by alkali heat treatment. Polylactic acid (PLA, Ingeo ™
Biopolymer 4043D, General Purpose Grade) was supplied by NatureWorks LLC (Min-
netonka, MN, USA). Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA, Commercial Grade) was purchased
from Cuckoo Trading Hebei Co., Ltd. (Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China). Dichloromethane
(DCM, Analytical grade Reagents) was purchased from Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy).
PLA-PHA/nHAp composite ﬁlms were prepared by solution casting method. First,
nHAp powder was dispersed in DCM using a magnetic stirrer for 24 h. PLA and PHA
solutions were prepared by dissolving their pellets in DCM at a concentration of 10 wt%.
Table 1 shows the formulations of PLA-PHA/nHAp composite ﬁlms. Each mixture from
the formulations was mixed for 72 h using a magnetic stirrer until homogenous. The
PLA-PHA/nHAp solutions were poured into a Petri dish for ﬁlm casting. Then, they were
air-dried at room temperature for 24 h and oven-dried at 40C for 72 h. After that, the
composite ﬁlms were stored in a desiccator for further characterization and measured for
their thickness. The thickness of each sample is approximately 0.50–0.70 mm.

2.2. Characterization of PLA-PHA/nHAp Composite Films
The mechanical properties of PLA-20PHA and PLA-PHA/nHAp composites such as
tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and % elongation at break were investigated by tensile
test (according to ASTM D882-10) using a universal testing machine (INSTRON/5565,
Norwood, MA, USA) with a load cell of 5 kN and a crosshead speed of 250 mm/min at
room temperature. Five specimens with 1 cm width and 10 cm length from each composite
were performed.
The cross-section microstructure of pure PLA, PLA-20PHA, PLA/5nHAp composites,
and PLA-PHA/nHAp composites were observed using a scanning electron microscope
(SEM, JEOL, JSM-6010LV , Tokyo, Japan). Before testing, the cross-section of the composites
after tensile testing were coated with gold sputtering.Polymers 2023 ,15, 1261 4 of 15
The thermal stability of the neat PLA and PHA, PLA-20PHA, PLA/5nHAp composite,
and PLA-PHA/nHAp composites was characterized using a thermal gravimetric analyzer
(TGA, TGA/DSC1, Mettler Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland) under a nitrogen atmo-
sphere from 30C to 500C with a ﬂow rate 50 mL/min and a heating rate 10C/min. The
TGA curves and the ﬁrst derivative of TGA curves (DTG) were obtained from the analysis
STAResoftware (version: 16.30).
Thermal properties of neat PHA, PLA-20PHA, and PLA-PHA/nHAp composites were
investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC, DSC 3+STAReSystem, Mettler
Toledo, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland). The samples were heated from  50 to 200Cwith
a heating rate of 10C/min, under nitrogen at ﬂow rate of 50 mL/min followed by a
cooling process down to  50C and second heating with the same procedure. The DSC
thermograms provide the thermal properties such as enthalpy of melting ( DHm), enthalpy
of crystallization and cold crystallization ( DHc,DHcc), glass transition temperature ( Tg),
crystallization and cold crystallization temperature ( Tc,Tcc), and melting temperature
(Tm). The degree of crystallinity was calculated according to Equation (1) [18]:
Xc (%) = [( DHm DHc)/(DHm0w)]100 (1)
where DHm0is the heat of melting of purely crystalline PLA (93 J g–1) [32] and PHA
(146 Jg–1) [33], and wis the weight fraction of PLA in the sample.
In vitro hydrolytic degradation of neat PLA, PLA-20PHA, PLA/5nHAp composite,
and PLA-PHA/nHAp composites was determined by soaking in phosphate buffered
solution (PBS) at a concentration of 0.1 M and pH 7.4. PBS solution was prepared by
dissolving 8.58 g of PBS powder (PBS powder, HiMedia, Maharashtra, India) in 1000 mL
distilled water, sterilized by an autoclave at a pressure of 15 lbs at 121C for 15 min. The
soaked specimens (10 10 mm) were incubated at 37C for 0 to 56 days. The PBS solution
in all test tubes was weekly replaced by fresh PBS. The specimens were removed from PBS
and wiped with a ﬁlter paper to remove surface water. Then, these specimens were rinsed
by distilled water for 3 times and oven-dried at a temperature of 40C to a constant weight
(Wd). The percentage of weight loss of the specimen during immersion in PBS solution was
calculated by Equation (2) [34]:
Weight loss (%) = [( W0 Wd)/W0]100 (2)
where W0is an initial weight of the specimen and Wdis the weight of the specimen after
removing from PBS and oven-dried at 40C.
2.3. Preparation of PLA-20PHA/5nHAp Fibers by Electrospinning Technique and Their
Electrospinnability at Various Applied High Voltages
To determine electrospinnability, PLA-20PHA/5nHAp solution at a concentration of
15 wt% was fabricated to be PLA-20PHA/5nHAp electrospun ﬁbers with an electrospin-
ning machine (Nanon, MECC, Fukuoka, Japan). Nanoﬁbers were spun at 90 mm distance
to a drum collector, which was covered with aluminum foil. The collector rotation speed
was set at 200 rpm. The high voltage between the needle tip and the drum collector was set
to 15, 20, and 25 kV . The PLA-20PHA/5nHAp solution was fed at a constant ﬂow rate of
1.0 mL/h . The electrospinning fabrication was carried out until the thickness was sufﬁcient
to be measured via diameter. The morphology of electrospun ﬁbers were observed by SEM
(JSM-6010LV , JOEL, Akishima, Tokyo, Japan). The ﬁber diameter was measured from SEM
images using image analysis software (Image J 1.53k, Wayne Rasband and contributors,
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
3. Results and Discussion
Characterization of PLA-PHA/nHAp Composites
Stress-strain curves of neat PLA, PLA-20PHA, and PLA-20PHA/nHAp at various
nHAp contents are shown in Figure 1a. All samples show a plastic deformation regionPolymers 2023 ,15, 1261 5 of 15
that is attributed to a ductile fracture behavior. The mechanical properties of neat PLA,
PLA-20PHA, and PLA-20PHA/nHAp at various nHAp contents are presented in Table 2.
The results of neat PLA and PLA/5nHAp were obtained from previous work [ 9]. An
increase in nHAp up to 5 phr shows the highest tensile strength (36.6 0.7 MPa) and
Young’s modulus (2.1 0.1 GPa) which have nearly the same elongation at break as the
other PLA-PHA/nHAp composites. Since nHAp is the nanoparticle ﬁller, its large surface
area has a signiﬁcant impact on the physical interaction between ﬁller and matrix. The
reinforcing mechanism of nHAp in PLA matrix has been explained in previous work [ 9].
So, it could be assumed that the addition of nHAp, especially at 5 phr, is the optimum
content that provided a well ﬁller dispersed in the composites, resulting in enhancing
the mechanical properties of the PLA-20PHA/5nHAp composite. Figure 1b shows the
stress-strain curves of the PLA/5nHAp composite and PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites ﬁlled
with PHA at various contents. The curves of PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites show plastic
deformation region that is attributed to a ductile fracture behavior as already mentioned
while the PLA/5nHAp composite shows no plastic deformation that is attributed to a
brittle fracture behavior. All of the PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites show poor Young’s
modulus and tensile strength compared with PLA/5nHAp composites, as shown in Table 2.
It indicated immiscibility between PLA and PHA according to previous works which were
observed in the literature [ 13,17,18,35,36]. However, their elongation at break was enhanced
by the addition of PHA. In addition, the effect of PHA contents on the Young’s modulus of
PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites shows that they were improved by 5 and 20 phr of PHA
compared with neat PLA. It indicated that the PHA act as a reinforcement ﬁller showing
the crystalline from PHA’s reinforcement effect [13].

 3. Results and Discussion 
Characterization of PLA- PHA/nHAp Composites 
Stress-strain curves of ne at PLA, PLA-20PHA, and PLA-20PHA/nHAp at various 
nHAp contents are shown in Figure 1a. All samples show a plastic deformation region 
that is attributed to a ductile fracture behavior. The mechanical properties of neat PLA, 
PLA-20PHA, and PLA-20PHA/nHAp at various nHAp contents are presented in Table 2. 
The results of neat PLA and PLA/5nHAp were obtained from previous work [9]. An in-
crease in nHAp up to 5 phr shows the highest tensile strength (36.6 ± 0.7 MPa) and Young’s modulus (2.1 ± 0.1 GPa) which have nearly th e same elongation at break as the other PLA-
PHA/nHAp composites. Since nHAp is the nanopa rticle filler, its large surface area has a 
significant impact on the physical interact ion between filler and matrix. The reinforcing 
mechanism of nHAp in PLA matrix has been explained in previous work [9]. So, it could 
be assumed that the addition of nHAp, especially at 5 phr, is the optimum content that 
provided a well filler dispersed in the compos ites, resulting in enhancing the mechanical 
properties of the PLA-20PHA/5nHAp composite.  Figure 1b shows the stress-strain curves 
of the PLA/5nHAp composite and PLA-PHA/5n HAp composites filled with PHA at var-
ious contents. The curves of PLA-PHA/5nHA p composites show plastic deformation re-
gion that is attributed to a ductile fracture behavior as already mentioned while the 
PLA/5nHAp composite shows no plastic deformation that is attributed to a brittle fracture 
behavior. All of the PLA-PH A/5nHAp composites show poor Young’s modulus and ten-
sile strength compared with PLA/5nHAp compos ites, as shown in Table 2. It indicated 
immiscibility between PLA and PHA according to previous works which were observed

PHA/5nHAp composites shows that they were improved by 5 and 20 phr of PHA com-
pared with neat PLA. It indicated that the PHA act as a reinforcement filler showing the 
crystalline from PHA’s reinforcement effect [13].

that PHA-added samples showed a lack of in terfacial adhesion between PLA and PHA,

composites with various nHAp contents are shown in Figure 4. The neat PLA and PHA
show one-step degradation. In contrast, the PLA-20PHA and PLA-20PHA/nHAp with
all contents of nHAp show degradation in two steps: the ﬁrst one is degradation of PHA
and the second one is degradation of PLA. First mass loss of the PLA-20PHA and PLA-
20PHA/nHAp composites is around 17–24%. Their thermal stability was evaluated from
DTG curves that are summarized in Table 3. Tonset of the PLA-20PHA/nHAp compos-
ites slightly shift to the higher temperature when nHAp content increases. Due to the
extremely high thermal stability of nHAp, as shown in our previous work [ 9], the thermal
stability of the composites in this study was improved by the high thermal stability of
nHAp. According to Rakmae et al. [ 39], the higher thermal stability of ﬁller acts as a
barrier preventing heat transfer to the matrix. It indicated that thermal stability of the
composites was improved by the addition of nHAp that has better thermal stability than
PLA and PHA.
Figure 5 shows the TGA and DTG curves of neat PLA and PHA, PLA/5nHAp compos-
ite, and PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites with various PHA contents. As shown in Table 3,
PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites showed the decreasing of their Tonset when increasing PHA
contents. This phenomenon was attributed to the lower thermal stability of PHA corre-
sponding to Jimenez et al. [ 18]. From the results of TGA analysis, it could be concluded that
the thermal stability of the composites was improved by the addition of nHAp, whereas
their thermal stability was dropped by the addition of PHA.Polymers 2023 ,15, 1261 8 of 15

chains in a crystalline structure, resulting in a increase in Tcc [42]. On the other hand, Tg

in Figure 7. The weight loss of neat PLA, PLA-20PHA, and PLA/5nHAp composite after

composite with 2.5, 5, and 10 phr of nHAp is 3.46%, 5.18%, and 7.55%, respectively. It
indicated the in vitro degradation increased with increasing nHAp contents. This was due
to the dissolution of nHAp and its hydrophilic properties. Moreover, the agglomeration of
nHAp particles makes the liquid medium easy to access, resulting in accelerates the degra-
dation [ 34,41]. The weight loss of PLA-PHA/5nHAp composites with 5, 10, and 20 phr of
PHA is 4.11%, 4.91%, and 5.18%, respectively. Since higher surface area from the surface
roughness is a factor inﬂuencing the biodegradation rates [ 16]. In this study, addition of
PHA induced surface roughness of the composites. In vitro degradation increased with
increasing PHA contents. However, PLA-20PHA/10nHAp showed the highest in vitro
degradation. The weight loss results correspond to SEM micrographs in Figure 8. The
surface of the samples have changed in morphology after immersion in PBS solution. The
surface of the composites were eroded and the rough surface, crack, and hole were created,
especially the composites with 20PHA. However, the blend and the composites showed
more morphological change than neat PLA.

4. Conclusions 
PLA-PHA-based nanocomposites filled with  nHAp from fish scales were success-
fully prepared by the solution casting method. The dispersion of filler in the matrix and 
compatibility between two or more phases are significant factors in the mechanical prop-
erties of the composites. PLA-PHA-based na nocomposite with 20 phr of PHA and 5 phr 
of nHAp is the optimum content that gave the best mechanical performance with electro-
spinnability, compared to the other PLA-PH A-based nanocomposites . The addition of 
PHA induced thermal degradation and promoted in vitro degradation. However, the ten-
sile strength and the thermal stability of the PLA-PHA-based composites were enhanced 
by the addition of nHAp. Since the composit es in this study were prepared from bio-
materials with medically interesting properties  such as osteoconductivity from nHAp, bi-
odegradation, and biocompatibi lity from PLA and PHA, they may be used as medical 
devices in bone tissue engineering. Additi onally, PLA-20PHA/5nHA p electrospun fibers 
from optimal electrospinning conditions will be selected for scaffold fabrication and will 
be studied in vitro cell culture later.

4. Conclusions
PLA-PHA-based nanocomposites ﬁlled with nHAp from ﬁsh scales were successfully
prepared by the solution casting method. The dispersion of ﬁller in the matrix and compat-
ibility between two or more phases are signiﬁcant factors in the mechanical properties of
the composites. PLA-PHA-based nanocomposite with 20 phr of PHA and 5 phr of nHAp is
the optimum content that gave the best mechanical performance with electrospinnability,
compared to the other PLA-PHA-based nanocomposites. The addition of PHA induced
thermal degradation and promoted in vitro degradation. However, the tensile strength
and the thermal stability of the PLA-PHA-based composites were enhanced by the addi-
tion of nHAp. Since the composites in this study were prepared from biomaterials with
medically interesting properties such as osteoconductivity from nHAp, biodegradation,
and biocompatibility from PLA and PHA, they may be used as medical devices in bone
tissue engineering. Additionally, PLA-20PHA/5nHAp electrospun ﬁbers from optimal
