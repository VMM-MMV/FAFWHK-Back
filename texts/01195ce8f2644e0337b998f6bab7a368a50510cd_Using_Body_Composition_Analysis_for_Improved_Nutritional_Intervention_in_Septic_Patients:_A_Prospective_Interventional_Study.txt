Abstract: The study aimed to determine whether using body composition data acquired through
bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) to adjust diet formulas could improve outcomes in septic
patients. There were 132 septic patients in medical intensive care units enrolled in the prospective,
randomized, double-blind, interventional study. For the intervention group, dietitians had access to
BIA data for adjusting diet formulas according to body composition variables on days 1, 3, and 8. The
patients were also stratiﬁed based on nutritional risk using the modiﬁed Nutrition Risk in Critically
ill (mNUTRIC) score. Patients with intervention were more likely to achieve caloric and protein
intake goals compared to the control group, especially in the low-risk group. The intervention did not
signiﬁcantly affect mortality, but the survival curves suggested potential beneﬁts. The high-risk group
had longer ICU stays and mechanical ventilation duration, which were mitigated by the intervention.
Certain body composition variables (e.g., extracellular water to total body water ratio and phase
angle) showed differences between high-risk and low-risk groups and may be related to patient
outcomes. Non-invasive body composition assessment using BIA can help dietitians adjust diet
formulas for critically ill septic patients. Body composition variables may be associated with sepsis
outcomes, but further research with larger patient numbers is needed to conﬁrm these ﬁndings.
Keywords: sepsis; body composition; phase angle
1. Introduction
Sepsis, a life-threatening systemic illness characterized by organ dysfunction resulting
from infection, is a common reason for admission to intensive care units (ICUs) and is
associated with high mortality rates [ 1]. The key indicator of sepsis-induced organ dysfunc-
tion is an acute change in the total sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score [ 2,3].
However, this score does not account for nutritional status or body composition variables.
Our previous data revealed that patients with immune deﬁciencies or impaired immune
responses had poorer outcomes [ 4], especially those with underlying comorbidities [ 5]. In
ICU patients with sepsis, poor nutritional status and immune response can further worsen
the condition. Notably, patients who did not receive sufﬁcient calories by day 7 had higher
28-day mortality rates [6].
Hospitalized patients are often at risk of malnutrition, which may be due to disease-
related catabolic states or inadequate nutrition supply [ 7–10]. Early enteral feeding has
been proven to reduce ICU and hospital mortality and has become a current standard
Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3814. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15173814 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrientsNutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 2 of 18
practice [ 11]. Conversely, some studies have suggested that intentional hypocaloric feeding
could reduce infection rates and mortality, irrespective of nutritional risk [ 12–14]. The
conﬂicting associations regarding true caloric needs and clinical outcomes may reﬂect the
complex and heterogeneous nature of the ICU population. Furthermore, these studies did
not consider body composition variables when adjusting the diet formula based on the
patients’ body composition.
Body composition refers to the percentage of fat, bone, and muscle in a person’s
body. Non-invasive bio-electrical impedance analysis (BIA) can be used to analyze body
composition, allowing for the assessment of different weight components such as lean
body mass and fat mass. This method is based on the electrical properties of tissues
and reﬂects the relationship between water content and the body’s electrical resistance.
Different body tissues have different water content, electrical conductivity, and electrical
resistance. A change in these parameters in individual organs and tissues indicates the
presence of pathology. We used these changes in sepsis to help the dietitian. By monitoring
body composition variables for muscle loss, ﬂuid levels, and cellular health, we may gain
valuable insights into sepsis outcomes. In particular, lean analysis enables us to monitor
lean body mass and extracellular water (ECW)/total body water (TBW) values in the
body. Additionally, phase angle (PA), which measures cellular resistivity and reﬂects
cell membrane integrity and overall cellular health, could serve as a prognostic factor of
survival [ 15,16]. BIA has been proposed as a valuable tool for assessing nutritional risk and
monitoring the response to nutrition in critical care settings in the future [17].
In our study, we deﬁned nutritional intervention as the dietitian’s ability to utilize the
patient’s BIA data as an additional reference for prescribing the appropriate diet formula.
The primary aim of this study was to determine whether septic patients in the nutritional
intervention group experienced better outcomes ([1] primary outcomes: length of stay and
mortality, [2] secondary outcomes: amount of caloric and protein intake, percentage of
patients meeting caloric and protein goals) compared to septic patients in the control (non-
interventional) group. The dietitian in charge of the patients in the nutritional intervention
group was provided with the BIA data, whereas the control group did not receive such
intervention. Additionally, patients were stratiﬁed by nutritional risk according to the
modiﬁed Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) score for further analysis.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patient Enrollment
We enrolled septic patients from medical ICUs at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, a 2700-bed tertiary teaching hospital in southern Taiwan, between August 2020 to
December 2022 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer: NCT04989569). Patients were excluded if they
met any of the following criteria: (1) age < 18 years, (2) conditions that may interfere with
the accuracy of BIA measurement (e.g., limb amputation, skin wounds in areas for sensor
attachment), and (3) absence of informed consent signed by patients or their surrogates.
2.2. Study Design
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, interventional study. The investi-
gators used a random number generator to divide the enrolled patients into two groups:
the control group (dietitian-prescribed diet formula based on clinical judgment without
knowledge of BIA data) and the intervention group (BIA data disclosed to the dietitian
for reference). The registered dietitians in charge of the patients in the intervention group
were encouraged to use BIA data for adjusting the diet formula according to the patient’s
body composition variables. Patients and other medical team members caring for the
enrolled patients were blinded to the randomization. The study design was approved by
the Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital without any conﬂict of
interest (Approval No: 201901875A3C501).Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 3 of 18
2.3. Diet Formula Adjustment Policy
The nutritionist creates a diet based not only on the calorie and protein principle.
There are other components in the food besides those mentioned, as well as carbohydrates,
fat, sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus content. We also take enteral and par-
enteral nutrition into consideration. The dietitians recommended the amounts of caloric
and protein intakes based on the guidelines for adult critically ill patients, which were
endorsed by the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the American Society for
Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P .E.N.) [ 18]. Registered dietitians provided and
adjusted nutritional prescriptions for all participants primarily based on clinical conditions,
laboratory data results, and discussions with the medical team. In the intervention group,
the additional policy adopted by the dietary treatment guidelines allowed for adjusting
the dietary concentration when there was excessive extracellular water, as long as gas-
trointestinal tolerance was considered. If skeletal muscle mass loss occurred rapidly, the
dietitians could adjust the diet formula to provide higher protein. For patients with acute
renal failure and excessive extracellular water accumulation and muscle loss, the dietitians
would adjust the concentration of protein, sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus
content in the formula.
2.4. Measurements
All enrolled patients underwent non-invasive body composition measurements on
day 1, day 3, and day 8 (if alive). The data for the SOFA score were also collected on day
1, day 3, and day 8. Dietitians recorded daily actual energy (caloric) and protein intake of
the patients, including intake from enteral and parenteral routes, from day 1 to day 8. The
goals for caloric intake were set at 20 kcal/kg and for protein intake at 1.2 g/kg per day.
2.5. BIA Measurements
We performed the measurement of body composition using the InBody S10 (Biospace
Co, Ltd., Cheonan, Republic of Korea) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. This
machine is a body composition analyzer based on the direct segmental multi-frequency
bioelectrical impedance method. In brief, the examinee assumed a supine posture for
approximately 10–15 min before the test, ensuring no contact between the examinee’s
body and conductors during testing. We used touch-type electrodes, attaching them to the
examinee’s hands and feet. Patients’ latest weight and height were entered as essential
information for body composition analysis. The InBody S10 then analyzed the measure-
ment results based on the input data of the patient. The outputs included intracellular
water, extracellular water, total body water (TBW), protein mineral, body fat, soft lean
mass, fat-free mass (FFM), weight, skeletal muscle mass, body fat mass, percentage of body
fat, body mass index (BMI), segmental lean analysis, segmental water analysis, total and
segmental water ratio (ECW/TBW), body cell mass (BCM), bone mineral content (BMC),
arm circumference (AC), arm muscle circumference (AMC), waist circumference, visceral
fat area, basal metabolic rate (BMR), TBW/FFM, body water history (12 times accumu-
lated results), and impedance of each segment and frequencies (impedance, reactance,
phase angle).
2.6. Statistics
All data were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquar-
tile range (IQR) depending on normal distribution. The Pearson chi-square test was used
for categorical data, and Student’s t-test or Mann–Whitney U test was used for numerical
data to compare between groups. For comparative analyses among four groups (2 2;
combined intervention or control with high or low nutritional risk score [modiﬁed NUTRIC
score]), we used the Pearson chi-square and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or
Kruskal–Wallis test as a non-parametric alternative to ANOVA. Cox regression model
for survival analysis and Kaplan–Meier analysis were used to determine the effect of the
groups on patient survival. We compared mortality hazard ratios between groups usingNutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 4 of 18
Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis for 28-day mortality. Statistical analyses
were conducted with a two-tailed p-value < 0.05 considered as signiﬁcant. SPSS software
(version 22; IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses.

3.1.1. Baseline Characteristics
A total of 132 patients (63 in the control group, 69 in the intervention group) were
enrolled in the study. The baseline characteristics, severity scores, suspected site of infection,
and underlying comorbidities were comparable between the two groups. Additionally,
patients were categorized into high-risk ( n= 93) and low-risk ( n= 39) groups based on their
mNUTRIC scores ( 6 vs.5). Patients in the high-risk group were older and had higher
severity scores (APACHE II, PSI, CURB 65) and comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease). The lung was the most commonly
suspected source of infection causing sepsis in the high-risk group (Table 1 and Figure 1).

3.1.2. Primary Outcomes
Comparison between the control group and intervention group revealed comparable
outcomes. However, the intervention group seemed to have lower day 7 and day 28
mortality rates, although the difference was not statistically signiﬁcant. Patients in the high-
risk group had a longer length of stay in the ICU and on mechanical ventilator compared
to the low-risk group. Mortality rates between the two risk groups were comparable
(Table 2 and Figure 1). The survival curve of the intervention group appeared to be
better, but the survival curves between the control and intervention groups did not show
signiﬁcant separation (Figures 2 and S1). The patients with higher modiﬁed NUTRIC
scores appeared to have poorer survival, but the survival curves did not show signiﬁcant
separation (Figures 3 and S2).

The amounts of caloric intake and protein intake during the ﬁrst week were com-
parable between the control and intervention groups. However, the amounts of caloric
intake and protein intake were signiﬁcantly higher in the low-risk group compared to the
high-risk group on most days of the ﬁrst week (Figure 4 and Table S1).

There was no difference between the control and intervention groups regarding the
percentage of patients who met the caloric goal (20 kcal/kg) and protein goal (1.2 g/kg)
during the ﬁrst week. However, compared with the high-risk group, patients in the low-risk
group had a higher percentage of patients who met the caloric and protein goals during
the ﬁrst week (Figure 4 and Table S2).
3.1.5. Serial Severity Score for All Patients and Grouped by Intervention or Risk
The baseline SOFA scores were comparable between the control and intervention
groups, but the SOFA score was higher in the intervention group on day 8. The low-risk
group had better SOFA scores at baseline and during the ﬁrst week compared to the high-
risk group. However, the decline of SOFA from day 1 to day 3 was more signiﬁcant in the
high-risk group (Table 3 and Figure 5).
3.1.6. Serial Body Composition Variables for All Patients and Grouped by Intervention
or Risk
Serial values regarding body composition variables were comparable between the
control and intervention groups. The high-risk group had higher serial ratios of extracellular
water to total body water (ECW/TBW). The low-risk group had borderline higher values ofNutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 8 of 18
phase angle (50 kHz-Whole Body Phase Angle) at baseline and signiﬁcantly higher phase
angle values compared to the high-risk group. Moreover, an increase in body fat mass was
borderline higher in the high-risk group (Table 4 and Figure 5).

whether they received nutritional intervention. Group A comprised patients with high
mNUTRIC scores who received nutritional intervention, Group B included patients with
low mNUTRIC scores who received nutritional intervention, Group C consisted of patients
with high mNUTRIC scores who did not receive nutritional intervention, and Group DNutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 9 of 18
contained patients with low mNUTRIC scores who did not receive nutritional intervention.

4. Discussion
In this prospective, randomized, controlled study, we have obtained valuable ﬁndings.
Firstly, patients who received intervention were more likely to achieve higher caloric and
protein intake, particularly those in the low-risk group compared to the high-risk group.
Secondly, critically ill patients with high nutrition risk on admission (high-risk group)
showed longer lengths of stay in the ICU and a higher need for mechanical ventilation.
However, in the intervention group, the differences in ICU stay and duration of mechanical
ventilation between high-risk and low-risk groups were mitigated. Thirdly, although not
statistically signiﬁcant, the survival curves appeared more favorable in the intervention
group compared to the control group and in the low-risk group compared to the high-
risk group. Fourthly, non-invasive body composition variables, such as ECW/TBW and
50 kHz-whole body phase angle, could assist dietitians in adjusting diet formulas and may
be associated with the outcomes of critically ill patients with sepsis.
In a state of sepsis, the so-called oxidative stress is due to inﬂammation and the
generation of a huge amount of free radicals that damage cell membranes and make them
particularly permeable. If the food contains some of the natural antioxidants-polyphenols,
ﬂavonoids, vitamins, etc., they may contribute to the control of inﬂammation. Such data
would allow a broader view of the pathogenesis of sepsis. However, it is out of the scope of
the current study. Nevertheless, managing the outcomes of sepsis requires a multi-pronged
approach that looks at different aspects of the patient’s health and response to treatment.
The additional procedure in this study involved non-invasive measurement of body
composition variables three times (on day 1, 3, and 8) for all enrolled patients. The
procedure took about 10 min each time and did not interfere with patient care. In the
control group, BIA data was not disclosed to the clinical team, while in the intervention
group, the data were released to the registered dietitian for possible adjustments in the diet
formula. The study was designed to ensure blinding of other medical staff in the ICU. The
presence of a dietitian in the ICU can be crucial for optimal patient care, but it is worth
noting that not all ICUs have access to a dietitian [ 19]. For those without a dietitian, the
supplemental BIA data could serve as valuable additional information for the medical
teams. Moreover, the time required for body composition measurement is not too long,
making it suitable for a high-stress ICU setting with high levels of burnout [20].Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 15 of 18
The stratiﬁcation of nutritional risk by mNUTRIC score upon admission to the ICU
proved to be effective. It outperformed body mass index in deﬁning nutritional status and
could be useful for predicting survival in patients with sepsis. The modiﬁed NUTRIC score
includes age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II score), SOFA
score, number of comorbidities, and hospital stay before admission to ICU. It has also
shown promise as a useful tool for predicting mortality in severe pneumonia [ 21], which
is the most common source of infection in ICU patients with sepsis. Therefore, including
severity scores for pneumonia (PSI and CURB-65 score) at baseline provided a reference
point for comparison.
In our study, we not only collected baseline characteristics of enrolled patients but also
provided serial SOFA scores and body composition variables for comparison both between
and among groups. These data were relevant to understanding sepsis progression and
changes in nutritional status. For instance, a sequential decrease in SOFA score indicated
an improvement in sepsis. We hypothesized that dynamic changes in data would be more
informative than one-time measurements. This hypothesis was supported by our previous
research, which demonstrated the importance of dynamic data for predicting outcomes in
septic patients [22].
To assess secondary outcomes, we comprehensively analyzed the caloric and protein
intake amounts and the percentage of patients meeting preset dietary goals from day 1
to day 8. Our ﬁndings revealed that intervention seemed to facilitate patients in the low-
risk group to achieve their energy targets compared to those in the high-risk group. This
difference could be attributed to the high-risk group’s greater illness severity, which may
have affected their ability to digest and have slower gastric motility. Additionally, the higher
prevalence of underlying morbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and chronic kidney
disease (CKD) in the high-risk group may have exacerbated the condition. Stress-induced
upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which was common in severe septic patients [ 23], might
have further hindered scheduled nasogastric tube feeding in these patients. Although the
intervention of involving a dietitian did not signiﬁcantly improve diet input for high-risk
patients based on body composition variables, it did seem to enhance diet adjustment for
patients in the low-risk group, who appeared to tolerate changes better.
Regarding mortality, we observed that early changes in SOFA scores could serve
as a prognostic marker for 28-day sepsis mortality [ 24]. After treatment, serial SOFA
scores demonstrated a decline in both intervention and control groups as well as in the
high-risk and low-risk categories. However, on day 8, the intervention group exhibited
higher SOFA scores compared to the control group, indicating a less favorable recovery.
Notably, the decline in SOFA score from day 1 to day 3 was more evident in the high-risk
group than in the low-risk group, suggesting a faster recovery rate in the former. These
unexpected features may partially explain why the survival curves, although appearing
better in the intervention group compared to the control, or in the low-risk group compared
to the high-risk group, did not reach statistical signiﬁcance. Our simple intervention
did not signiﬁcantly impact mortality. It is essential to acknowledge that septic patients’
survival depends on multiple factors, including immune response, and not solely on caloric
intake [ 4,6,17]. It is crucial to emphasize that our intervention did not harm septic patients,
indicating its safety. However, it is evident that addressing sepsis outcomes requires
a multifaceted approach that considers various aspects of patient health and response
to treatment.
An essential aspect of our study was the collection of serial body composition variable
data, which hold potential for monitoring nutritional status. The nutritional status of
patients is closely linked to their exercise capacity, which, in turn, may be associated with
the duration of mechanical ventilation. Building on insights from our previous study,
where appropriate diet intervention was shown to alter nutritional status [ 21], we aimed to
investigate whether our intervention could also inﬂuence outcomes in this regard. Each
body composition variable we examined could carry its own clinical signiﬁcance. For
instance, we observed that positive accumulated ﬂuid balance, leading to body weightNutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 16 of 18
gain, was associated with unfavorable outcomes in severe inﬂuenza pneumonia [ 25]. The
accumulation of ﬂuid might be linked to increased Extracellular Water (ECW) to Total Body
Water (TBW) ratio, which can be easily measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis
(BIA). We noted some signiﬁcant differences in ECW/TBW and phase angle between the
high-risk and low-risk groups. These differences could partly be attributed to variations
in ICU stay duration and mechanical ventilation duration between the groups, though
our study did not establish a deﬁnitive relationship. However, a prospective study, in
which the majority of patients were admitted to the ICU due to acute respiratory failure
rather than sepsis, found that critically ill patients with lower phase angles tended to
have higher in-hospital mortality [ 26]. These body composition variables might also have
implications for the survival of septic patients. For example, higher values of the phase
angle were indicative of better cellular health and could potentially serve as a biomarker for
sepsis resolution. Additionally, other variables such as soft lean mass and skeletal muscle
mass may play a role in determining the duration of mechanical ventilation. Critically ill
patients often experience rapid muscle wasting during the ﬁrst 7 days [ 27], which correlates
with the severity of their illness, length of hospital stay, and mortality risk [ 28]. Although
we observed lower soft lean mass and skeletal muscle mass in patients at high-risk and
receiving intervention (group A compared to group B), these differences did not reach
statistical signiﬁcance. A larger-scale study might be necessary to provide more robust
conclusions in this regard.
The strength of our study lies in its prospective, randomized, double-blind, inter-
ventional design. Blinding was ensured for patients and most medical staff except for
the dietitian. Comprehensive data on caloric and protein intake, including energy from
intravenous infusions and sedation medication, were recorded, enhancing the reliability of
the results. Moreover, the study included serial data on SOFA scores, body composition
variables, and caloric and protein intakes throughout the study period, rather than rely-
ing solely on admission data. The intervention itself is relatively simple and feasible for
application in clinical practice.
However, our study has some limitations. The number of enrolled patients was smaller
than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to difﬁculties in conducting
relationship analysis. The quarantine policy prevented the enrollment of septic patients
with COVID-19, limiting the generalizability of our results to this particular population.
Additionally, our study was conducted in a tertiary hospital with adequate resources and
a highly skilled medical team specializing in treating sepsis [ 29]. Therefore, the results
may not be applicable to smaller hospitals with more limited resources. Nevertheless, the
non-invasive procedure of body composition analysis is straightforward and can be easily
incorporated into protocols in various settings.
In summary, using non-invasive body composition variables obtained through bio-
electrical impedance analysis to adjust diet formulas is beneﬁcial for critically ill septic
patients. Patients who received this nutritional intervention were more likely to achieve
higher caloric and protein intake, particularly in low-nutritional risk patients according to
the modiﬁed nutrition risk in critically ill score. Although the intervention only showed
borderline improved survival, it appeared to inﬂuence the length of stay in the ICU and the
duration of mechanical ventilation, which tended to be longer in high-risk patients. Among
the body composition variables, ECW/TBW was signiﬁcantly higher in the high-risk group,
while the phase angle was higher in the low-risk group.
5. Conclusions
Non-invasive body composition variables, such as ECW/TBW and phase angle, could
assist dietitians in adjusting diet formulas and may be associated with improved outcomes
in critically ill patients with sepsis.Nutrients 2023 ,15, 3814 17 of 18
