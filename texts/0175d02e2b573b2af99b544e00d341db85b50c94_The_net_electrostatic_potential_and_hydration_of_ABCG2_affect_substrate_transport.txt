ABCG2 is a medically important ATP-bin ding cassette transporter with crucial
roles in the absorption and distribution of chemically-diverse toxins anddrugs, reducing the cellular accumula tion of chemotherapeutic drugs to
facilitate multidrug resistance in cancer. ABCG2 ’s capacity to transport both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic compounds is not well understood. Here weassess the molecular basis for substrat e discrimination by the binding pocket.
Substitution of a phylogenetically-cons erved polar residue, N436, to alanine in
the binding pocket of human ABCG2 pe rmits only hydrophobic substrate
transport, revealing the unique role of N436 as a discriminator. Molecular
dynamics simulations show that this ala nine substitution alters the electro-
static potential of the binding pocket fav oring hydration of the transport pore.
This change affects the contact with sub strates and inhibitors, abrogating
hydrophilic compound transport while re taining the transport of hydrophobic
compounds. The N436 residue is also requ ired for optimal transport inhibition
of ABCG2, as many inhibitors are functionally impaired by this ABCG2 muta-tion. Overall, these ﬁndings have biomedical implications, broadly extending
our understanding of substrat e and inhibitor interactions.
ABCG2 is a medically-relevant ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.
In cancer cells, it modi ﬁes the cytotoxic response to many structurally
diverse and mechanistically-unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs1.
ABCG2 also plays a key role in protecting hematopoietic stem cells
from low-oxygen environments and cytotoxins2,3. Further, genetic
variation of ABCG2 is associated with increased risk of gout and
hyperuricemia due to ABCG2 transport of the endogenous substrateuric acid
4. Understanding the factors contributing to the interactions
between ABCG2 and its substrates/inhibitors will provide a basis forthe rational development of advanced therapeutics. Our under-standing of the molecular interactions that ABCG2 employs to recog-nize inhibitors and substrates has been signi ﬁcantly advanced by cryo-
EM structural studies
5–10. These studies were crucial in identifying thefunctional role of amino acid F439 as a molecular “clamp ”that is used
in vitro and in live cells to actively engage substrates and inhibitors inthe ABCG2 binding pocket
11. Although inhibitors and substrates enter
the same binding pocket, the substrate/inhibitor-bound ABCG2 cryo-
EM structures reveal that substrates and inhibitors may be dis-tinguished by differences that arise in part from the size of the com-pound: inhibitors occupy a larger volume and have a greater numberof contact points within the binding pocket
7. Like ABCB112,t h e r ei s
overlap in substrate and inhibitor binding contacts in ABCG26,7,9.
One conundrum among the ﬁve ABCG transporter family
members (ABCG1, ABCG2, ABCG4, ABCG5, and ABCG8), is thatABCG2 ’s broad substrate speci ﬁcity includes the ability to transport
both hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates. Human ABCG2Received: 14 December 2021

and N436, in the binding pocket13. These two residues have been
speculated to contribute to ABCG2 hydrophobic and hydrophilicsubstrate transport in vivo. Cryo-EM structural studies reveal that the
polar residue, N436, interacts with some substrates. When ABCG2
harboring an N436A substitution is puri ﬁed and reconstituted into
proteoliposomes, the substrate-stimulated ATPase activity andtransport are impared
7,9.
Here we show in cellulo that the substitution of N436A does not
abolish the function of ABCG2, but profoundly impacts substrateselection. The previously published cryo-EM structures show that theevolutionarily conserved N436 residue in the ABCG2 binding pocketplays a unique role in substrate transport. Using a potent combinationof mutagenesis, in cellulo functional assays, molecular dynamicssimulations (MDS), and structural modeling, we show that this con-
served polar residue in ABCG2 has pleiotropic effects on the interac-
tions with substrate and inhibitor.
Results
Identi ﬁcation of the binding pocket residues required for ther-
mal stabilization and transport of Hoechst 33342
Weﬁrst examined how ATP binding altered ABCG2 substrate interac-
tion using thermal stability experiments. ATP treatment of ABCG2-WTexpressing membranes produced a 2.5 °C increase in the T
mcompared
to untreated membranes, indicating an ATP-dependent thermal sta-bilization (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Next, we used cells expressing
either ABCG2-WT or ABCG2-K86M (a mutant capable of binding, but
not hydrolyzing ATP
14) and performed a cellular thermal shift assay15
with or without depletion of intracellular ATP by non-toxic 2-deoxy-d-glucose and sodium azide treatment. Depletion of intracellular ATPproduced reductions in the T
mfor both ABCG2-WT and ABCG2-K86M,
and since this mutant is catalytically inactive, the ATP interaction aloneseems suf ﬁcient to produce thermal stabilization (Supplementary
Fig. 1b). Based on our previous studies
11, we hypothesized that sub-
strates might thermally stabilize ABCG2. The ABCG2 substrate,Hoechst 33342, thermally stabilized ABCG2-WT in a dose-dependentmanner in the absence of ATP (Supplementary Fig. 1c). We did not test
it in the presence of ATP because an ATP-bound ABC transporter
would bind substrate poorly as it is in a low af ﬁnity state
16. The reduced
afﬁnity for substrate in an ATP-bound state was con ﬁrmed by com-
paring the ﬁndings for Hoechst 33342 interaction with ABCG2-K86M
and ABCG2-E211Q (catalytically inactive mutants) in the absence andpresence of ATP (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d). These ﬁndings provided
the basis for our decision to omit ATP in our experiments assessing theimpact of ABCG2 binding pocket mutations on Hoechst 33342interaction.
To investigate the importance of the contacts identi ﬁed in ABCG2
cryo-EM structures to Hoechst 3342 thermal stabilization, we devel-
oped retroviral expression vectors containing variants of ABCG2 with
binding pocket mutations (L405A, F432A, T435A, T435F, N436A,F439A, V546A, and M549A). Membrane vesicles were prepared fromAbcg2- KO MEFs expressing these ABCG2 mutants. Isothermal shift
assays were performed on the membranes by varying the Hoechst33342 concentration at a ﬁxed, empirically determined, optimal tem-
perature (see “Methods ”). Hoechst 33342 produced concentration-
dependent stabilization of ABCG2-WT (Fig. 1a). The effect of the
binding pocket residues on Hoech st 33342 thermal stabilization was
not uniform and revealed interesting patterns: the alanine substitutionof residues T435 in transmembrane helix 2 (TMH2), and V546 andM549 in TMH5, slightly reduced Hoechst 33342 thermal stabilization,
suggesting that Hoechst 33342 sti ll strongly or moderately bound
these ABCG2 mutants. In contrast, alanine substitution of residuesF432, N436, and F439 in TMH2 mostly prevented Hoechst 33342thermal stabilization, suggesting a loss in Hoechst 33342 interac-tion (Fig. 1a).In a peristaltic transport model such as that proposed for ABCG2
7,
transport is a dynamic process that requires the initial entry of sub-strate into the binding pocket, permeation and coordination of sub-strate, prior to an ATP-induced conformational change that powers
efﬂux. We hypothesized that variants with binding site mutations that
had the largest effect on the Hoechst 33342-induced thermal stabili-zation would also display impaired Hoechst 33342 transport. Hoechst33342 cellular accumulation assays were used to determine the rela-tionship between Hoechst 33342 thermal stabilization/interaction andtransport. Expectedly, the F439A protein was not thermal stabilized byHoechst 33342 and was incapable of transport (Fig. 1a, b). This is
consistent with the proposed role of F439 as a molecular clamp thatengages substrates
11. The substitutions F432A and M549A also reduced
Hoechst 33342 transport, which corresponded with their impairedABCG2 thermal stabilization/interaction. Intriguingly, the N436A sub-
stitution markedly reduced Hoechst 33342 thermal stabilization/
interaction with no loss in transport. Instead, ABCG2-N436A hadenhanced Hoechst 33342 transport, as re ﬂected by the greater
reduction in the intracellular level of Hoechst 33342 (Fig. 1b). This was
unexpected as puri ﬁed ABCG2-N436A reconstituted into proteolipo-
somes has been reported to be incapable of estrone 3-sulfatetransport
7. The relationship between thermal stabilization/interac-
tion and transport is depicted in the heatmap of the binding pocketmutants (Fig. 1c) and shows ABCG2-N436A is an outlier with improved
transport and loss of the thermal stabilization/interaction.
N436A enhances Hoechst 33342 transport and alters con-
formational response
The ABCG2-N436A substitution displayed markedly reduced intracel-
lular Hoechst 33342 indicated by decreased steady-state accumulation(Fig. 1d). The difference between ABCG-WT and ABCG2-N436A was not
due to a difference in Hoechst 33342 initial uptake, given that the initialrate of uptake was linear and the slo pes virtually identical for ABCG2-
WT and ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 1d). The steady-state level of Hoechst
33342 was twofold lower in ABCG2-N436A cells (Fig. 1d). Steady-state
drug levels represent an equilibrium between uptake and ef ﬂux rates,
which can be used to estimate the rate of drug ef ﬂux
17. The twofold
lower steady-state level of Hoechst 33342 in cells expressing ABCG2-
N436A, therefore, indicates an estimated twofold increase in ef ﬂux
(Fig. 1d). Direct monitoring of Hoechst 33342 ef ﬂux is not possible
because of its avidity for binding to the minor groove of DNA, leavinglittle free Hoechst 33342 available for assessing ef ﬂux. This effect is
also responsible for Hoechst 33342 ’s cytotoxicity, a property that we
utilized as an additional approach to assess ABCG2 transport activity
18.
The Hoechst 33342 cytotoxicity assay showed that N436A-expressingcells exhibited a twofold greater Hoechst 33342 EC
50than that for
ABCG2-WT cells, indicating strong protection compared to the emptyvector expressing cells (Fig. 1e). The greater reduction in Hoechst
33342 cytotoxicity in ABCG2-N436A may be because Hoechst 33342
cytotoxicity occurs by a dual process of DNA binding and topoi-somerase inhibition, both of which promote cytotoxic DNA damage.An investigation of the ATPase activity of ABCG2-WT and ABCG2-N436A showed that the ATP-concentration response curve for ABCG2-N436A shifted to the left, with a 5.7-fold lower EC
50value, whereas
there was no signi ﬁcant difference in the maximum effect (E max)o fA T P
between WT (E max=4 8 + / −19 nmol min−1mg protein−1and EC 50=1 . 7
+/−1.4 mM) and N436A (E max=4 0 + / −6 nmol min−1mg protein−1and
EC50=0 . 3+ / −0.1 mM) (Fig. 1f). Consistent with the lower EC 50value of
ATP (0.3 mM) for ABCG2-N436A, ABCG2-N436A was thermally stabi-lized by the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP at lower con-
centrations than ABCG2-WT (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Higher substrate
concentrations can inhibit ATPase activity
19. As expected, Hoechst
33342 dose-dependently reduced ABCG2-WT ATPase activity inmembranes with an IC
50of 35 μM (Supplementary Fig. 2b), consistent
with the literature20, while membranes from cells expressing ABCG2-Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40610-5

sistent with our impaired Hoechst 33342 thermal stabilization results(Supplementary Fig. 2b and Fig. 1a).
We hypothesized that the ABCG2 conformational responses to
Hoechst 33342 binding may be altered by N436A substitution. TMH5of ABCG2 rotates between the apo-closed (inward-facing), and
outward-facing nucleotide-bound states
8with two residues in TMH5,
V534 and A537, capable of sensing native substrate-induced con-formational changes. After cysteine substitution, these residues formcross-links when closely apposed in the presence of an oxidant, asdepicted in Fig. 1g.

dimer formation in intact cells as previously described

Cell lines that expressed these ABCG2 chimeras were as follows:
ABCG2-WT or ABCG2-N436A and either V534C/C603S or A537C/

indicating that Ko143 blocked the formation of the outward-facingstate (Fig. 1h). Hoechst 33342 did not block CuPhen-induced dimer
formation by V534C (Fig. 1h). Unlike ABCG2-WT, the dimer formation
by V534C in the context of ABCG2-N436A was markedly increased aftertreatment of cells with Hoechst 33342, suggesting an enhanced ten-
dency towards the formation of an outward-facing state. To furtherdelineate if the ABCG2-N436A conformation was altered, we employed5D3, a conformationally sensitive ABCG2 antibody
21, which strongly
binds to the ECL3 when ABCG2 forms an inward-facing state5.S u b -
strate binding typically promotes the formation of an outward-facing
state, resulting in reduced or no effect of 5D3 binding. The strongerreduction in 5D3 binding for ABCG2-N436A by Hoechst 33342 com-pared to ABCG2-WT (Fig. 1i) suggested that ABCG2-N436A more
readily transitioned from an inward-facing conformation to anoutward-facing conformation after Hoechst 33342 binding.
Genetic and structure-based insi ghts into ligand interaction
ABCG1 is closely related to ABCG2, but prefers sterols whereas ABCG2
transports hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates. An analysis of theABCG1 and ABCG2 binding pocket regions that form the conserved
TMH2 reveals that ABCG1 ’s binding pocket contains predominantly
hydrophobic residues relative to ABCG2. The preponderance of var-iants in DNA sequence of ABCG2 from the Genome AggregationDatabase ( GnomAD v3.1.1 ) compared with ABCG1 suggests that
ABCG2 ’s binding pocket is still undergoing evolutionary adaptation
whereas ABCG1 is not (Supplementary Fig. 3). In accord with this, thegenomic DNA sequences in ABCG2 appear more divergent than thetranslated peptide sequences. These highly conserved binding pocketregions forming TMH2 in ABCG1 and ABCG2 suggest the functionalimportance (Supplementary Fig. 3).
To assess the potential contribution of N436A in discriminating
between substrates, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (MDS)
were used to investigate the initial binding interactions of threeABCG2 substrates displaying markedly different logP values: erlotinib(logP 2.3), Hoechst 33342 (logP 4.5), and tariquidar (logP 5.4), andcompared to MDS of the inward-facing ABCG2 with no inhibitor orsubstrate present (apo-inward state). ABCG2-WT and two ABCG2 var-iants were studied: ABCG2-N436A and ABCG2-N436A-L405A. L405 was
chosen based on our preliminary MDS data showing Hoechst 33342interacting with the L405 residue of ABCG2-N436A protein, consistentwith reports that some hydrophobic compounds interact with theL405 residue of ABCG2
6,9.I na c c o r d a n c ew i t he x p e r i m e n t a ls t u d i e s ,
these simulations were run using the highest resolution ATP-free
inward-facing cryo-EM structure available with the inhibitor removed
(PDB ID: 6ETI) and embedded in a solvated 80/20 POPC/Cholesterolbilayer. After equilibration, n= 3 replicate 300 ns simulations were
produced for each system, giving 900 ns of combined simulations persystem. To ﬁrst assess protein stability in the MDS of the inward-facingconformation, the backbone RMSD of ABCG2 of each ABCG2 system
was calculated, in the presence and absence of each compound(Supplementary Fig. 4). The time-dependent data for each indepen-dent simulation system (containing n= 3 concatenated replicate
simulations) is provided as a Source data ﬁle. For each system, the
RMSD plateaued within the ﬁrst 50 ns of the simulation to a value
consistent with thermal noise in an elongated membrane protein,indicating that ABCG2 did not undergo any large-scale conformationalchanges. Unless otherwise stated, the results discussed below weredetermined using statistical averages across the n= 3 replicate simu-
lations and cluster analysis of the protein.
In assessing these MDS, we ﬁrst considered the overall changes to
apo-inward ABCG2 (Fig. 2a) on incorporation of the N436A and N436A-
L405A mutations. In the membrane-embedded ABCG2-WT, MDS showsolvent-accessible water wires within each individual monomer of theTMD, while the transport pore situated at the interface of the two TMDmonomers is dehydrated (Fig. 2b). Substitution to N436A provided a
favorable region for the permeation of water molecules, with 4 + / −3
water molecules present in the binding pocket across the replicate(n= 3) 300 ns simulations in the apo inward-facing conformation
(Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 11a). This change was maintained in the
double mutant N436A-L405A (Fig. 2d). In the ﬁrst steps of substrate
uptake, the substrate enters the transmembrane cavity and movestoward a minimum energy binding site, predicted to be locatedbetween the F439 clamps. While capturing the entire ABCG2 transportcycle is beyond the current capabilities of MDS, the ABCG2 6ETI cryo-EM structure provides a unique opportunity to gain insight into theinitial stages of the permeation of these varied compounds as the F439“clamping ”residues are close together, sterically hindering the entry
of substrates (Fig. 2a). This is unlike the tariquidar bound ABCG2-
structure (PDB ID: 7NEQ), where tariquidar occupies the regionbetween residues F439. While the docked orientation of tariquidar is
different (see below and Supplementary Fig. 7) from previously pub-
lished structural data (PDB ID 7NEQ), it is important to note that Kowalet al. show that tariquidar can adopt multiple conformations within the7NEQ density map
9. QM calculations on the conformation of tariquidar
taken from the 7NEQ cryo-EM structure show that its geometry ishighly constrained by an induced ﬁt interaction with the protein dur-
ing the transport cycle (Supplem entary Data 1). While the cryo-EM
conformation of tariquidar is not accessible using ﬂexible docking
approaches, several contact residues are conserved between MDS andthe 7NEQ cryo-EM structure (Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting theMDS samples intermediate conformations along the tariquidar trans-port pathway.
In studying the broad substrate speci ﬁcity of ABCG2, it is impor-
tant to note the concentration of polar residues lining the intracellularregion of the transmembrane pore (Supplementary Fig. 5). This pro-vides a favorable environment for initial coordination of hydrophilicsubstrates, such as erlotinib, in this region of the transport poreFig. 1 | Characterization of the impact of ABCG2 binding pocket mutations on

and ABCG2-N436A shows the all-atom RMSD of erlotinib is extremelysmall across the 900 ns combined replicate simulation (0.9 + / −0.2 Å
and 1.1 + / −0.2 Å, respectively), indicating the substrate is highly
coordinated in both. Substitution to N436A signi ﬁcantly hydrates the
erlotinib binding site (Fig. 2g), increasing the hydration number of the
substrate from 17 + / −7 in ABCG2-WT simulations (Fig. 2f) to 25 + / −8
water molecules within 4 Å of the drug in ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 2g),
further stabilizing this hydrophilic substrate (logP 2.3; erlotinib) in aposition close to its initial uptake conformation (Fig. 2g, h andSupplementary Fig. 5). This reduces the propensity of erlotinib to
permeate the transport pathway to the comparatively dehydratedF439 clamps (hydration number of 2 + / −2i nt h eA B C G 2 - W Ta n d1+/ −
1 in the ABCG2-N436A simulations). Based on these simulations, wetested if N436 substitution affected transport of hydrophilic sub-
strates. [
14C]-labeled erlotinib was poorly exported by ABCG2-N436A,
unlike ABCG2-WT (Fig. 2i). Furthermore, ABCG2-N436A was non-
functional for topotecan (logP 2.0, Fig. 2j) and mitoxantrone (logP
−0.5, Fig. 2k), in that it was unable to protect against their cytotoxicity.

Fig.2l) indicated that as predicted, for ABCG2-WT, estrone 3-sulfate
dose-dependently increased Hoechst 33342 accumulation, likely dueto its competition with Hoechst 33342 for the N436 binding site. Incontrast, accumulation of Hoechst 33342 by ABCG2-N436A was vir-tually unaffected by estrone 3-sulfate (Fig. 2l).
Hoescht 33342 has a logP of 4.5, consistent with a mildly hydro-
phobic substrate, yet contains three ionizable groups: the tetra-hydropyrazine amine (pKa 7.87), and two benzoimidazole groups withpKa ’s of 5.02 and 5.81
22. At pH 7, the tetrahydropyrazine amine is likely
to be protonated, resulting in an overall charge of +1 for Hoechst
3334223. Hoechst 33342 is positioned asymmetrically in the pore
throughout the MDS, where it lies between TMH1 and TMH2 of a singlemonomer (Fig. 2m and Supplementary Fig. 8). The sole interaction
with the opposing monomer is a single salt bridge between the tetra-hydropyrazine cation and E446, on TMH2 of the opposing monomer(Supplementary Figs. 6 and 8). In ABCG2-WT simulations, the stericbulk of Hoechst 33342 prevents the interaction of N436 with TMH1,restricting its orientation such that N436 forms hydrogen- πinterac-
tions with F432, located one helical turn above N436 (Fig. 2ma n d
Supplementary Figs. 6 and 8). Upon substitution to N436A, thisinteraction is lost, allosterically opening the F439-F439 ’clamp (Sup-
plementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 9), which likely facilitates
the permeation of Hoechst 33342 toward the center of the ABCG2transport pore, between the F439 clamps (Fig. 2n and Supplementary
Fig. 9). Substitution of L405 with alanine in the ABCG2-WT did notdiminish either Hoechst 33342 interaction or transport for ABCG2-WT(see Fig. 1a, b). Yet, substitution of both N436A and L405A resulted in a
marked loss of enhanced transport activity of ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 2p),
indicating that this hydrophobic residue is functionally important formaximal ABCG2-N436A transport. MDS of this double mutation indi-cate that the drug changes position, occupying the void volume cre-ated by N436A-L405A substitution, below and adjacent to the F439
clamps (Fig. 2o and Supplementary Fig. 10b). We also show that, like
the ABCG2-WT interaction, F439 is required for transport activity ofABCG2-N436A (Fig. 2p).
Based on the MDS of Hoechst 33342, we hypothesized that
ABCG2-N436A might prefer hydrophobic substrates. Using a cut-off oflogP > 3, we next tested transport of additional hydrophobic sub-strates: chlorin e6, purpurin 18, and pheophorbide a (PhA). Unlikehydrophilic compounds, hydrophobic compounds were still readilytransported by ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 3a). We further investigated the
effect of other polar residues (T434, T435, and Q437) close to the N436residue for substrate selectivity. The transport of hydrophobic sub-strates was not impaired by the alanine substitution of these polar
residues (N436A, T434A, T435A, and Q437A). However, the transport
of hydrophilic substrates in ABCG2-T434A, -T435A, and -Q437A wasimpaired to varying extents (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 11b, c).
Protection against the cytotoxic effect of mitoxantrone ’s cytotoxicity
was lost for ABCG2-T435A and -N436A, whereas ABCG2-T434A and-Q437A retained some protction against its cytotoxicitty. Likewise,
ABCG2-N436A was unable to protect against topotecan ’s cytotoxicity,
whereas ABCG2-T434A, -T435A, and -Q437A protected against thecytotoxic effect. These results indicate that N436A has the moststrongest effect on hydrophilic substrate transport (Fig. 3a).
We investigated the role of these polar residues for the electro-
static potential and water penetration into the pore of ABCG2. Sub-stitution to N436A introduced an area of negative electrostaticpotential into the binding pocket (Fig. 3b, c). Alanine substitution of
T434, T435, and Q437 had a similar effect on the electrostatic potentialof the transmembrane region as the N436A substitution (Fig. 3b–f).
However, in contrast to ABCG2-N436A, no water permeated into the
binding cavity after 15 ns of MDS equilibration (Figs. 2ca n d 3g–ka n d
Supplementary Fig. 11a) highlighting the dual nature of the roleof N436A.
Erlotinib and tariquidar are also known to behave as ABCG2
inhibitors
24,25. Unlike erlotinib, the hydrophobic inhibitor tariquidar
binds deeper within the transmembrane domain, sandwichedbetween the F439 hydrophobic gates (Fig. 4a, b and Supplementary
Figs. 7 and 8) where it forms transient π-stacking interactions, and is
stabilized by surrounding hydrophobic residues within the pore(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 7). The N436A substitution slightly
destabilizes the compound, increasing the all-atom RMSD of tar-
iquidar from 0.7 + / −0.2 Å in ABCG2-WT to 1.3 + / −0.2 Å in the
ABCG2-N436A simulations. In contrast to the hydrophilic substrate,erlotinib, the increase in hydration at the intracellular end of the poreresulting from the N436A substitution facilitates the permeation oftariquidar (logP 5.4) into the F439 clamps (Fig. 4c). On introduction
of a double substitution, ABCG2-N436A-L405A, tariquidar permeatesdeeper between the F439 clamping residues (Fig. 4d and Supple-
mentary Figs. 7 and 10), which suggests that it is adopting a substrate-like rather than inhibitor-like conformation. Substitution of bothN436A and L405A was associated with a localized loss of helix-helix
interactions between TMH1 and TMH2 which acted to widen the F439
clamps, increasing the C α-Cαdistance from 12.9 + / −0.7 Å to 13.5 + / −
0.5 Å (Supplementary Table 1). This is associated with a reorientationof tariquidar and its intercalation between the gating F439 sidechains, including transient observations of the drug adopting con-formations similar to the constrained cryo-EM structure (PDB 7NEQ).Tariquidar is known to be transported, albeit slowly, by ABCG2
9.W e
speculate that the ABCG2-N436A-L405A mutation may result inincreased transport rather than inhibition by tariquidar (Fig. 4d and
Supplementary Figs. 7 and 10).

thermal stabilization and transport inhibition by N436A substitution.Hoechst 33342 uptake was used as a probe to determine the impact oftransport inhibition.

Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:5035 6(Fig. 4e). Thermal stabilization was unexpected as inhibitors reduced
the thermal stability of ABCB115,26. Intriguingly, the N436A substitution
markedly reduced both inhibition and thermal stabilization; abolishingKo143 and tariquidar inhibition and strongly attenuating lapatinibinhibition (Fig. 4e, g). The conformationally sensitive 5D3 antibody was
used to evaluate if these inhibitors still promoted the formation of aninward-facing state which would be re ﬂected by increased 5D3
reactivity
27. As expected, for ABCG2-WT, all tested inhibitors increased
5D3 reactivity by at least 1.5-fold, suggesting that inhibitors generally
immobilize ABCG2-WT in the inward-facing conformation (Fig. 4f). In
contrast, for ABCG2-N436A, 5D3 reactivity was not uniformlyincreased by all KIs which suggested reduced capability of immobi-lizing ABCG2-N436A in the inward-facing conformation (Fig. 4f). Weextended this analysis to determine the impact of the N436A sub-
stitution on ABCG2 transport inhibition by 9 additional kinase inhibi-tors (KIs). Strikingly, transport inhibition by all the KIs was impaired bythe N436A substitution (Fig. 4g). The heatmap depicts how the N436
interaction is crucial for maximal inhibition and shows that the N436Asubstitution produced greater than a 50% loss in the inhibitory activityof Ko143, tariquidar, sunitinib, imatinib, ge ﬁtinib, nilotinib, and erlo-
tinib (Fig. 4h). Unlike ABCG2-WT which had virtually no correlation
between inhibitors ’hydrophobicity (logP) and transport inhibition
(Supplementary Fig. 12a), the inhibitors ’hydrophobicity (logP) weakly
correlated with transport inhibition in ABCG2-N436A (SupplementaryFig. 12b), supporting the idea that hydrophobicity contributes to thedrug binding/recognition mechanism. This moderate correlation

this work.
We further investigated the conformational change of ABCG2-
N436A produced by the KI using CuPhen-induced cross-linking assay(Fig. 5a, b). When ABCG2 is in the inward-facing state, the V534C and
A537C residues are too distant to form an intermolecular disul ﬁde
bond
8(see diagram Fig. 1g). The dimer formation occurs at V534C
when ABCG2 is in the outward-facing ATP-bound state, and this assayallows us to assess if inhibitors prevent conformational changes froman inward-facing to an outward-facing state. In the context of ABCG2-WT, the ABCG2 conformational response when engaging with KIsindicated that CuPhen-induced dimer formation by V534C was pre-
vented (Fig. 5a). In the context of ABCG2-N436A, a majority of the KIs
(erlotinib, lapatinib, imatinib, ge ﬁtinib, axitinib, and sunitinib) no
longer restricted dimer formation by V534C (Fig. 5a). We interpret the
loss of cross-link blocking by N436A substitution to indicate that theseKIs no longer block the transition to an outward-facing ATP-bound
state. Some of the KIs retained an ability to prevent V534C mediated
dimerization for ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 5a). We further interrogated
whether N436A substitution in ﬂuenced inhibitor interaction with the
binding pocket of ABCG2, by monitoring dimer formation throughCuPhen-induced cross-linking at A537C which is reported to form in

readily blocked dimer formation by A537C, with carbozantinib beingamong the most effective. Some exceptions were sorafenib, imatinib,and dasatinib (Fig. 5b). In the context of ABCG2-N436A, a majority of
the KIs still reduced dimer formation by A537C (Fig. 5b), suggesting
that these KIs could enter and interact with the binding pocket ofABCG2-N436A. This ﬁnding suggests that although many inhibitors are
able to enter the binding pocket of ABCG2-N436A, the inhibitors havean impaired ability to immobilize ABCG2-N436A in the inward-facingconformation. There seems to be a correspondence between the KI ’s
logP value and retention of blockade of ABCG2 dimer formation byV534C in the context of ABCG2-N436A (Fig. 5c). Importantly, only for
ABCG2-N436A, there was a close correspondence between a lowerlogP value and the loss of crosslink formation (Fig. 5c). For ABCG2-WT,
there was no discernable relationship between the KI ’s logP value and
transport inhibition (Supplementary Fig. 12).
MDS of the hydrophilic KI erlotinib interacting with ABCG2-WT
show that erlotinib is situated between the opposing V534 residues,physically preventing crosslinking (Fig. 5d and Supplementary Fig. 8).
In contrast, in the MDS of ABCG2-N436A erlotinib preferentially dwells~7 Å deeper in the pore of the ABCG2-N436A compared to ABCG2-WT(Fig. 5e and Supplementary Fig. 9). In this deeper location, erlotinib is
no longer positioned between the opposing V534 residues, facilitatingcrosslinking (Fig. 5a).
Discussion
Our current studies using functional assays, mutagenesis, structure-
based modeling, and MDS reveal factors accounting for ABCG2 ’sb r o a d
ability to readily transport both hydrophilic and hydrophobic sub-strates. Unlike other ABCG family members with binding pockets thatare predominantly composed of non-polar residues (i.e., ABCG1), themammalian ABCG2 subfamily exploits a phylogenetically conservedpolar asparagine, N436. Substitution with alanine reveals the impor-tance of N436 and other polar residues in the transmembrane pore topermit discrimination between hydrophilic and hydrophobic com-pounds, thereby providing fundamental insights into why ABCG2transports more diverse compounds than other ABCG family mem-
bers. The cross-linking and conformational antibody studies using the
N436A substituted ABCG2 substantiated the conformational changesand adaptations that were revealed by the MDS and informed how ahydrophobic preferring ABCG2-N436A interacts differently withligands from the ABCG2-WT. These ﬁndings sharply contrast with the
general correspondence between loss of ligand thermal stabilization(ligand interaction) and transport for both hydrophobic and hydro-philic substrates that occurs with the alanine substitution for theconserved phenylalanine, F439
11. Cross-linking studies suggest that
ABCG2-N436A also has an enhanced ability to “switch ”, induced by
substrate, to the ATP-bound outward-facing conformation. MDS
demonstrated that Hoechst 33342 repositioning in the transmem-
brane pore facilitates its transport. Importantly, an N436 interactionwas also requisite for inhibitory activity of the majority of inhibitors,which concurrently lose their ability to thermally stabilize ABCG2-N436A and become less capable of immobilizing ABCG2-N436A in theinward-facing conformation that was revealed through cross-linkingstudies ﬁrst employed by Orlando and Liao
8.
The increased Hoechst 33342 transport observed for the N436A
substitution was unexpected. Our studies suggest that N436 is a“selectivity switch ”in that hydrophobic substrates (e.g., Hoechst
33342, chlorin e6, purpurin 18, and PhA) are not negatively impactedby N436A substitution, whereas hydrophilic substrates like topotecan,
erlotinib, and mitoxantrone are not transported, which appears rela-
ted to the change in the electrostatic potential and hydration of thepore. Previous ﬁndings with the hydrophilic estrone 3-sulfate showed
that transport activity was lost when the N436A substitution wasintroduced
7.O u r ﬁndings showing estrone 3-sulfate has a reducedinhibitory effect on Hoechst 33342 transport by ABCG2-N436A high-
lights how fundamental this asparagine interaction is to transport byABCG2-WT in cellulo . These studies revealed a previously unknown
role for N436 in the coordination of Hoechst 33342 and other hydro-
phobic substrates, while underscoring an essential role for hydrophilic
substrates like topotecan, mitoxantrone, erlotinib, and estrone3-sulfate. MDS of ABCG2-N436A also suggested that the loss of theN436 polar side chain in ﬂuenced Hoechst 33342 position in the pore
and expanded the binding region (Supplementary Figs. 8b and 9b).This was further highlighted by transport studies that revealed addi-tional hydrophobic contacts (e.g., L405) in ABCG2-N436A (but notABCG2-WT) that supported ABCG2-N436A mediated Hoechst 33342transport (Fig. 2p). We speculate that this would not have been dis-
covered with puri ﬁed ABCG2-N436A unless it was reconstituted into
the exact membrane environment of cells. Notably, the formation of
Hoechst 33342-induced inward-closed ATP-bound state of ABCG2-
N436A underscores that the bound conformation of Hoechst 33342during the transport cycle is markedly different from ABCG2-WT. Therole of the electrostatic potential and water penetration into the porewas further revealed by the substit ution of additional polar residues
(T434A, T435A, and Q437A) in the binding pore which had no effect onhydrophobic substrate transport, but impaired hydrophilic substratetransport (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 11b, c). Although alanine
substitution of these polar residues (T434A, T435A, N436A, andQ437A) had a similar effect on the electrostatic potential of thetransmembrane region, it was notable that only the N436A substitu-
tion increased hydration of the transport pore, highlighting the unique
impact of N436 residue (Fig. 3b–k). Interestingly, alanine substitution
of adjacent threonine residues at positions 434 and 435 showed dif-ferent effects for the cytotoxicity of topotecan and mitoxantrone(Supplementary Fig. 11b, c). We speculate that the differential effect ofthe alanine substitution among these polar residues and hydrophilicsubstrate transport is likely related to an as yet unquanti ﬁable com-
bination of the effect on the electrostatic potential and the movementof water into the pore. The differences in the effects of alanine sub-stitution among these residues do not seem to be easily explained bythe compounds physicochemical properties (volume, Van der Waals
surface area, logP, H bond acceptor, and H bond donor) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11d).
ABCG2-N436A showed the loss of inhibitor-induced thermal sta-
bilization along with an impairment in inhibition. This lost thermalstability simply cannot be generalized to all ABC transporters and theirinhibitors. ABCB1 inhibitors like verapamil and tariquidar did notinduce thermal stabilization
26: these inhibitors reduced the ATP-
induced thermal stabilization of ABCB1 but did not directly competewith ATP. Thermal stabilization studies of ABCG2 were conductedwithout exogenous nucleotide because of ABCG2 ’sl o wa f ﬁnity for
ligand when ATP is bound
16. The reduction of ATP-induced thermal
stabilization of ABCB1 by inhibitors is likely related to mechanistic
differences between ABCG2 and ABCB1. TMD and NBD coupling forABCB1 are not as strict as they are for the homodimer ABCG2. Thisseems consistent with ABCB1 being less susceptible to inhibitor-reduced ATPase activity
10.
The water ﬂow for ABCG2 has been posited to generally impact
transport of all ABCG2 substrates using the behavior of one hydro-philic substrate, mitoxantrone
28. Elimination of the ABCG2 hydro-
phobic di-leucine (L554, L555) valve by double alanine or cysteinemutations (L554A L555A and L554C L555C) enhanced water ﬂow and
reduced mitoxantrone transport. We show that substitution of thepolar asparagine, N436, with a non-polar alanine generally eliminated
transport of multiple hydrophilic substrates but retained transport of
hydrophobic substrates, suggesting that a loss of a polar side chainretains proper valve function. MDS show that substitution of N436with alanine alters the electrostatic potential of the pore and increasesthe permeation of water molecules near N436A. These ﬁndingsArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40610-5
Nature Communications |         (2023) 14:5035 10suggest that the effect of N436A substitution is dependent on the
properties of the substrate.
Many ABCG2 inhibitors were deleteriously impacted by the
N436A substitution, showing profound reductions in their ef ﬁcacy.
This broad general effect on inhibitors suggested a common but key
mechanism that negatively impacted inhibitors by loss of the polarN436 in ABCG2. The cryo-EM structure of ABCG2 with tariquidar showsmultiple binding modes
9and one infers that this might occur with
other inhibitors. Based on our studies, loss of the polar side chainN436 slightly increases the volume of the binding pocket and disruptsinhibitor interactions with multiple residues, thereby impeding theirability to coordinate and lock ABCG2 into an inward-facing con-formation. Many of the inhibitors with impaired ability to block cross-linking at V534C were the least hydrophobic whereas the inhibitorsthat retained the ability to keep ABCG2-N436A in the inward-facing
conformation were more hydrophobic, suggesting certain physico-
chemical properties of inhibitors are important. The hydrophobicinhibitors vemurafenib and lapatinib still inhibited ABCG2-N436Atransport (Fig. 4g, h). While vemurafenib retained the ability to keep
ABCG2-N436A in the inward-facing conformation, lapatinib no longerblocked the transition to an outward-facing ATP-bound state (Fig. 5a,
c). We speculate that lapatinib has an alternative mode of inhibition,which appears to act by blocking the action of F439 through π-stacking
and hydrophobic interactions with these so called “clamps ”.
Our current studies feature a mechanistic account of how a con-
served N436 substitution produced an unexpected gain in transport
function, coupled with a loss in thermal stabilization/interaction. The
increased Hoechst 33342 transport is likely related to untethering the
substrate from the restraint of the transmembrane pore ’sp o l a ri n t e r -
actions and an increased propensity to form an ATP-bound outward-facing state revealed by the V534C cross-linking. For inhibitors, N436appears to be a key anchor that enables many inhibitors to adopt athermostable ligand-bound conformation within the binding pocket.Thus, the phylogenetic conservation of N436 seems to play a key rolein ligand-based conformational transitions and substrate selection.

Substrate accumulation assays
The intracellular accumulation of ﬂuorescent Hoechst 33342, pheo-
phorbide a, chlorin e6, and purpurin 18, ABCG2 substrates, was used todetermine the function of ABCG2. For Hoechst 33342 accumulationassay, MEFs were seeded into a 96-well black clear bottom plate(Corning #3603) at 20,000 cells/well and 0.5 μM Hoechst 33342, and
either Ko143 or the test inhibitor (0.002 –10μM) were added to the
culture medium followed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in the dark.Thereafter, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twicewith 200 μL ice-cold PBS and the ﬂuorescence of Hoechst 33342 was
then quantitatively determined with a Synergy H4 microplate reader
(BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 355 nm and
an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The accumulation of Hoechst33342 was normalized to protein concentration as determined usingthe BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). The data werenormalized by the proportion accumulated relative (%) to vectorcontrol. For the time-dependent Hoechst 33342 accumulation assay,10μM Hoechst 33342 was treated for different time periods (0.5, 1, 1.5,
2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, and 90 min). Relative intracellular Hoechst 33342levels in the MEFs were normalized to vector control at 90 min. For theother ﬂuorescent substrate accumulation assay, 0.5 μM pheophorbide
a, 5μMc h l o r i ne 6 ,o r5 μM purpurin 18 were treated for 1 h at 37 °C in
the dark. The intracellular accumulation of pheophorbide a, purpurin
18, or chlorin e6 was measured at an excitation wavelength of 405 nmand an emission wavelength of 667 nm. For [
14C]-labeled erlotinib
accumulation assay, cells were seeded into a 24-well cell culture plateat 200,000 cells/well, and 0.1 μM[
14C]-erlotinib was added to the
culture medium followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark.Thereafter, the medium was removed and cells were washed twice with1 mL ice-cold PBS. For the determination of intracellular [
14C]-erlotinib,
cells were lysed in 0.5 mL of 1 N NaOH, neutralized with 0.25 mL of 2 NHCl, and mixed with ProSafe FC+ liquid scintillation cocktail (MeridianBiotechnologies Ltd, Tadworth, UK). The total radioactivity was mea-
sured by liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instrument, Inc.,
Columbia, MD).
Plasma membrane preparation
MEF cell lines or HEK293 cell lines were pelleted and washed with PBSbefore suspension in a hypotonic buffer (0.5 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.1 mM
EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and freezing. After gentle thawing, cellswere pelleted by centrifugation, suspended in 2.5 mL of hypotonicbuffer, and spun for 40 min in an SW32Ti swinging bucket rotor at100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended into Homogenization Buffer
(250 mM sucrose, 50 mM Tris, 250 µMC a C l
2, and protease inhibitors)
and homogenized with 50 strokes of a tight Dounce pestle. Following
centrifugation at 500 × gfor 5 min, the pellets were then resuspended
in Homogenization Buffer and homogenized again before an addi-tional 500 × gcentrifugation step. The supernatants of each spin were
pooled together and layered over a 5 ml 35% sucrose pad formed in50 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and centrifuged in the SW32Ti rotor for 1.5 h at100,000 × g. The interface was carefully removed and diluted with
Dilution Buffer (50 mM Tris, (pH 7.4), 25 mM sucrose) and the crudemembranes were pelleted at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in
25 mM Tris (pH 7.4) and incubated overnight at 4 °C on ice. Thesepellets were then passed 10× through a 27-gauge needle before proteinquanti ﬁcation. The membranes were typically usually used immedi-
ately or stored at −80 °C for one thaw cycle.
ATPase assays
For each sample, puri ﬁed membrane vesicles (25 µg) from ABCG2-
expressing HEK293 cells were dissolved in 50 µL total volume reactionArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40610-5

0.5 mM EDTA, 5 mM sodium azide to block F-type ATPases, and 1 mMouabain to inhibit Na
+/K+ATPase). Samples for Hoechst 33342 dose-
response experiments were brought to the desired drug concentration
(0.02, 0.2, 2, 10, 20, or 50 µM) or treated with vehicle and allowed to
preincubate for 30 min at room temperature. ATP was freshly pre-pared in reaction buffer at twice the desired ﬁnal concentration and
brought to pH 7.0 and then incubated for 35 min at 37 °C. In ATP dose-response experiments, ATP was varied between 0 and 2.5 mM, whilefor Hoechst 33342 dose-response experiments, 2 mM ATP was used.Blanks were determined by cotreatment with 2 mM sodium vanadate.Reactions were stopped by immediate immersion in ice and cen-trifugation at 21,000 × gat 4 °C. In total, 50 µL of the supernatant was
transferred to a 96-well plate and reacted with an equal volume ofdeveloping mix, a 1:1 mixture, made immediately before use, of 1%
ammonium molybdate in water and freshly-made 6% ascorbate in 1 N
HCl
29. Plates were incubated at room temperature for 5 min for full
color to develop and read at a wavele ngth of 800 nm. Quantitation was
performed using phosphate standards diluted in reaction buffer in arange of 0 –50 nmol, with standards and samples being treated
identically.
Cellular and membrane thermal shift assays
Cellular thermal shift assays were performed as described previously11.
Human ABCG2-expressing membrane vesicles were prepared fromMEFs lacking murine Abcg2 and programmed to express human
ABCG2 as described
11. In some cases, human ABCG2-expressing
membrane vesicles from HEK293 cells (purchased from Solvo Bio-technology, Budapest, Hungary) were used. The thermal shift assaywas adapted according to ref. 30.B r i e ﬂy, membrane vesicles (5 µg
protein/20 µLﬁnal reaction volume) in 1x assay buffer (SB PREDIVEZ ™
Reagent Kit for BCRP, SBPVR4, Solvo Biotechnology) were heated in athermocycler for 3 min at various temperatures (37 –78 °C) to establish
a thermal denaturation curve. Samples were then treated with ice-coldPBS supplemented with NP-40 to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.8%. Sub-
sequently, ultracentrifugation (at 100,000× gfor 20 min at 4 °C) was
performed to precipitate the denatured proteins. The supernatant was
subjected to immunoblot analysis using an ABCG2 antibody (Enzo Life
Sciences Inc., BXP-53, 1:500). Based on an extrapolation from thethermal denaturation curve that produced 99% loss of protein in thesupernatant, 65 °C was selected for wild-type (WT), 62 °C for L405A,T435F, and F439A, 64 °C for F432A and V546A, 67 °C for E211Q, N436A,and T435A, and 68 °C for K86M and M549A in the absence of MgATP togenerate an isothermal dose-response curve. In the presence ofMgATP (4 mM), 72 °C was selected for K86M and E211Q. To assess theability of ligands to thermally stabilize ABCG2, membranes were ﬁrst
incubated with ligand for 60 min at 37 °C. Samples were then heatedfor 3 min. The signal intensity of the heated sample was normalized to
the signal intensity of the unheated sample (WT and mutants) and the
signal intensity was reported as % of either unheated control or % ofABCG2-WT. The ligand concentrations required for thermal stabiliza-tion are not true binding constants because they represent two pro-cesses: binding and thermal stabilization. To assess the ability ofHoechst 33342 to thermally stabilize ABCG2-K86M or E211Q in thepresence of MgATP, membranes were ﬁrst incubated with 4 mM
MgATP for 30 min at 37 °C, and then Hoechst 33342 (1, 5, 10, 20, 50,and 100 μM) were added to the samples. Samples were incubated for
60 min at 37 °C and then heated for 3 min.
Immunoblot analysis
Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (4 –15% Criterion TGX Precast
Gel, Bio-Rad), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amer-sham Protran 0.45 μm NC, GE Healthcare). Immunoblot analysis was
performed using primary antibody against ABCG2 (BXP-53, Enzo LifeSciences Inc., 1:500) and was subjected to further incubation with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody raised against rat IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., 1:10,000) as previouslydescribed
11. Chemiluminescence signal was detected using LI-COR
Odyssey Fc Imaging system (Image Studio 5.2). The bands were ana-
lyzed using LI-COR Image Studio Lite Ver 5.2 software for quanti ﬁca-
tion of western blot signals. As a membrane marker, immunoblotanalysis was performed using primary antibody against ATP1A1(sodium potassium ATPase alpha 1, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO,1:5000). As the secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated secondary anti-body raised against mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-tories Inc., 1:10,000) was used.
Disul ﬁde crosslinking
Disul ﬁde crosslinking was adapted according to ref. 8. Brie ﬂy, the
Abcg2- KO MEF cell line was transduced with the retrovirus harboring
cDNAs encoding either the human mutant ABCG2-C603S+V534C,
C603S+V534C+N436A, C603S+A537C or C603S+A537C+N436A. Otherretroviral expression constructs were developed that harboredcysteine substitutions at either of the conformational sensing residues,V534 or A537 in a C603S background. Cells were incubated with eitherligand (20 μM) or sodium orthovanadate (1 mM, Sigma Aldrich, S6508)
as a positive control for 20 min. Copper phenanthroline was preparedby combining 500 mM copper(II) sulfate (Sigma Aldrich, 451657) inwater with 500 mM 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate (Sigma Aldrich,P9375) in ethanol, 6 mM (Cu
2+)/(1,10-phenanthroline) 3.S u b s e q u e n t l y ,
the medium was replaced with medium containing the same ligands
and 300 μM( C u2+)/(1,10-phenanthroline) 3. The copper phenanthroline
oxidation proceeded for 45 min. Cells were then washed with PBS,resuspended in 25 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% n-Dodecyl- β-
D-
Maltoside (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, 89902), 0.2% cholesteryl hemi-
succinate (Cayman Chemical, 25698), and protease inhibitors (cOm-plete EDTA-free Protease Inhibito r Cocktail, Roche, 05056489001) and
incubated on a nutating rocker at 4 °C for 1 h to solubilize membranes.Samples were spun at 15,000 × g and the soluble fraction was mixedwith SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing 40 mM EDTA (Fluka, 03690)and 40 mM N-ethyl maleimide (Sigma Aldrich, E1271).

Cytotoxicity assays
CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay (Promega) was used todetermine the cytotoxicity of Hoechst 33342, topotecan, and mitox-antrone using MEFs lacking murine Abcg2 but expressing the human

followed by incubation for 3 days.
5D3 antibody shift assay for a ssessing the interaction between
ABCG2 ligand and ABCG2-N436A
To determine ligand-induced ABCG2 conformational changes, we used
the conformationally sensitive 5D3 antibody we developed21that binds
to extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) of ABCG25.B r i e ﬂy, Alexa-647 labeled 5D3
antibody binding to intact cells was measured by ﬂow cytometry as
described previously27.M E F s( 3×1 05cells/sample) were preincubated

ligands in Dulbecco ’s PBS for 10 min at 37 °C before labeling with
0.5μg/mL of 5D3 antibody (sc-18841, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa

before incubation with the secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG-Alexa-647 (A21235, ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, 1:100) in 0.5% FBS/PBS for
30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed with 0.5% FBS/PBS and resus-pended in 0.5% FBS/PBS. To detect dead cells, cells are stained withArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40610-5

cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using FlowJo v10 software.Alexa-647 labeled 5D3 antibody was excited with a 640 nm laser andemission was collected with a 670/30 ﬁlter. PI for dead cell exclusion
was excited with a 562 nm laser and emission was collected with a 610/
20ﬁlter. 5D3 labeling was presented as the percent of the untreated
control ﬂuorescence measured in the presence of 5D3-A647 alone for
each protein.
Molecular dynamics simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the GroningenMachine for Chemical Simulation engine, version 2019.4 (GROMACS2019.4)
31, with the GROMOS 54a7 force ﬁeld32. The cryo-EM structure
of ABCG2 in the ATP-free inward-facing (PDB ID 6ETI) conformationwas used as the starting structure for simulations as it is the highest
resolution ABCG2 structure available
6. The residues missing from the
cryo-EM structure were modelled using the ABCG2 Alphafold struc-tural prediction (AlphaFold Protein Structure Database entry:Q9UNQ0)
33. To investigate the impact of point mutations on ABCG2 in
simulation, PyMOL (version 2.5.0, The PyMOL Molecular GraphicsSystem, Schrödinger, LLC) was used to introduce a series of pointmutations (N436A and N436A + L405A) to give starting coordinates forABCG2-N436A and ABCG2-N436A-L4 05A, in addition to ABCG2-WT.
The Automated Topology Builder and Repository (ATB)
34was used to
develop united atom coordinates and GROMOS 54a7 compatableparameters for each drug at the predominant protonation state at
physiological pH (7.0) (ATB repository molecule ID for erlotinib:
763850; Hoechst 33342: 29940; tariquidar: 1324). As previous struc-tural studies suggest that ABCG2 operates via a peristalsis mechanismand does not form an occluded conformation that contains a stable,well-de ﬁned substrate binding space
7, a single drug molecule of either
erlotinib, Hoechst 33342 or tariquidar was docked into the TM pore ofeach ABCG2 model using Autodock Vina. After assessment of thedocked poses against others with a score within 5 kJ/mol, the mostenergetically favorable scoring docked pose was used as the startingconformation for MDS
35. Simulations were performed on the WT and
each mutant ABCG2, in the presence and absence of docked substrate,
giving 16 different systems in total. Each system was embedded in a
20% cholesterol and 80% POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) bilayer and solvated using the simple pointcharge (SPC) explicit water model
36,a n d0 . 1 5 Mo fN a+and Cl−ions.
Each system was energy minimized using a steepest descent algorithmand subsequently equilibrated with decreasing restraints on the pro-tein backbone in six sequential 1 ns simulations (1000 kJ mol
–1nm–2,
500 kJ mol–1nm–2, 100 kJ mol–1nm–2,5 0 k J m o l–1nm–2,1 0 k J m o l–1nm–2,
and 0 kJ mol–1nm–2) using a 2 fs timestep. The coordinates from the
ﬁnal frame of each equilibrated system were used as the starting
conﬁguration for 300 ns production simulations, using an NPT
thermodynamic ensemble. MDS use classical mechanics to calculate
the time-evolution of the system to a local minimum-energy con-formation. The position and orientation of all molecules in thesimulation, including the docked compounds, changes throughoutthe simulation due to their thermal motion. To increase the statisticalsampling of the ABCG2/substrate conformation space and ensureconvergence of the docked compounds, non-biased productionreplicate ( n= 3) simulations of each ABCG2 system were performed
and a new random starting velocity was assigned at the start of eachreplicate simulation. In all simulations, the temperature was main-tained at 300 K using the Bussi-Donadio-Parrinello velocity rescalethermostat and a coupling constant of 0.1 ps. Pressure was main-
tained at 1 bar using semi-isotropic pressure coupling using the
Berendsen barostat with a 0.5 ps coupling constant and an iso-thermal compressibility of 4.5 × 10
–5bar−1. The length of covalent
bonds was constrained using the LINCS algorithm37implemented in
GROMACS 2019.4. Electrostatic interactions were calculated usingparticle mesh Ewald and Van der Waals interactions were calculated
with a cut-off of 1.2 nm.
Analysis of simulation trajectories
Analysis of each system was performed on the n=3r e p l i c a t e3 0 0n s
production simulations, to give a combined simulation time of 900 ns.Frames collected at 0.1 ns intervals. Data is reported as the mean ±standard deviation for the n= 3 production simulations, each lasting
300 ns. Simulations were analysed using the GROMACS 2019.4 toolkit,Visual Molecular Dynamics software (VMD) version 1.9.4

Quantum mechanical (QM) calculations
All QM calculations of Tariquidar (taken from PDB ID 7NEQ) werecarried out using Gaussian 16.3
42. The geometry of tariquidar reported
in PDB ID 7NEQ was optimized in the gas phase, at the M06-2X/6-31 + G(p) level of theory, followed by frequency calculations at thesame level to con ﬁrm the nature of the calculated stationary points. An
alternative geometry was optimized using the ATB (outlined above)followed by a single point energy calculation at M06-2X/6-31 + G(p)level of theory. All calculations are reported as gas phase energies (E) atthe M06-2X/6-31 + G(p) level of theory.
Data analysis and curve ﬁtting
All experimental data analysis and curve ﬁtting were carried out using
GraphPad Prism (version 9.0.2). Melting temperature (T m)c u r v eo r

Top and bottom are plateaus in the units of the Yaxis.
Apparent EC 50and IC 50values were calculated from dose-
response data using nonlinear regression analysis. All experimentswere independently repeated at least three times. All Pvalues were
calculated using two-tailed Student ’sttest.
