Abstract
Soft microfluidic systems play a pivotal role in personalized medicine, particularly in in vitro diagnostics tools and disease 
modeling. These systems offer unprecedented precision and versatility, enabling the creation of intricate three-dimensional 
(3D) tissue models that can closely emulate both physiological and pathophysiological conditions. By leveraging innova-
tive biomaterials and bioinks, soft microfluidic systems can circumvent the current limitations involving the use of polydi-
methylsiloxane (PDMS), thus facilitating the development of customizable systems capable of sustaining the functions of 
encapsulated cells and mimicking complex biological microenvironments. The integration of lab-on-a-chip technologies with 
soft nanodevices further enhances disease models, paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies. The current research 
concepts underscore the transformative potential of soft microfluidic systems, exemplified by recent breakthroughs in soft 
lithography and 3D (bio)printing. Novel applications, such as multi-layered tissues-on-chips and skin-on-a-chip devices, 
demonstrate significant advancements in disease modeling and personalized medicine. However, further exploration is 
warranted to address challenges in replicating intricate tissue structures while ensuring scalability and reproducibility. This 
exploration promises to drive innovation in biomedical research and healthcare, thus offering new insights and solutions to 
complex medical challenges and unmet needs.

Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of biomedical engineering, the 
evolution of microfluidics (Fig.  1) has been instrumental 
in revolutionizing research methodologies and therapeutic 
interventions [1 , 2]. Particularly noteworthy is the emer -
gence of soft microfluidic systems, which have ushered in 
ground-breaking approaches to diagnostics and disease mod-
eling, offering unprecedented precision and versatility [3 , 4].Microfluidics, characterized by manipulating fluids at 
a microscale, finds applications across diverse disciplines 
such as chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, the most 
significant advancements have been witnessed within the 
realm of soft microfluidics, owing to its ability to emulate 
physiological conditions more closely [5 , 6].
This concept paper aims to provide an insightful explo-
ration and concise overview on the state-of-the-art tech -
niques utilized in biofabrication, with a special focus on soft 
microfluidics. By delving into the innovative biomaterials 
and bioinks employed, as well as the sophisticated designs 
implemented, the transformative potential of these technolo-
gies in diagnostics and disease modeling will be elucidated.
Central to the discussion is the recognition of the pivotal 
role played by three-dimensional (3D) in vitro models and 
bioinks in advancing biomedical research [6 , 7]. These tools 
enable researchers to create more accurate representations 
of human tissues and organs, thereby enhancing understand-
ing of tissue functioning and disease pathology, and thus 
facilitating the development of tailored therapeutic strategies  * Joaquim M. Oliveira

[1, 7]. Moreover, the importance of integrating lab-on-a-
chip technologies with soft nanodevices is gaining a new 
impetus to address the current societal challenges aiming to 
develop cost-effective advanced research tools and mimetic 
disease models to be used as alternatives to animal models. 
By synergizing biofabrication techniques with advanced soft 
materials and microfluidic platforms, researchers can create 
highly customizable systems capable of mimicking complex 
mechanical and biological environments with unparalleled 
fidelity [8 ].
Cutting‑edge concepts: exploring 
the frontiers of biofabrication and soft 
microfluidic systems
Recent breakthroughs in biofabrication technology have led 
to significant progress in the development of soft microflu-
idic systems, as demonstrated in Table  1 [9–14], detailing 
different techniques along with their corresponding materi-
als and applications in disease modeling, addressing various 
challenges.
These advancements are crucial for creating more accu-
rate and complex models of human diseases, which mirror 
physiological conditions closely [1 , 2, 6, 8, 13–15].
Microfluidic in vitro models offer numerous advantages 
over traditional culture systems, organoids, and in vivo 
models [16– 18]. These devices provide precise control 
over the cellular microenvironment, enabling the recreation 
of complex physiological conditions such as gradients of 
nutrients, oxygen, and signaling molecules [19 –22]. Lauren 
M. Delong et al. [23] reported a 3D-printed microfluidic 
device that was designed and fabricated to maintain the oxy -
gen gradient across precision-cut murine intestinal slices 
while being capable of coupling to external neurochemical recording techniques. The gradient was sustained from 
outlets below, allowing access to the slice from above for 
detection with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) and 
carbon-fiber microelectrodes [23]. A series of 11 outlet 
ports were designed to lay underneath the slice, connected 
to channels for delivering oxygenated versus deoxygenated 
media. The outlet ports were shaped in an oval design, with 
deoxygenated media delivered to the center of the slice and 
oxygenated media to the outer portion, mimicking the natu-
ral oxygen distribution in the intestine [ 23]. Another inter -
esting example of controlled gradients is the novel micro-
fluidic platform called Griddient [24]. Such type of device, 
designed by Cristina Sanchez-de-Diego et al., aims to study 
immune cell extravasation, migration, and endothelial bar -
rier permeability in vitro [24]. It allows for the creation of 
transient spatial and temporal gradients on demand, leverag-
ing capillary forces to generate reconfigurable gradients in a 
simplistic yet robust manner. The Griddient system consisted 
of an array of 32 microfluidic chambers for 3D culture con-
nected to reservoir wells, enabling the manipulation of nutri-
ent concentration throughout the platform [23]. That study 
demonstrated the platform’s ability to support the migration 
and proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells through a colla-
gen hydrogel, as well as the establishment of an endothelial 
monolayer that responds to inflammatory signals [24].
Additionally, microfluidic systems allow for the integra-
tion of multiple cell types and tissues in a controlled manner, 
thus facilitating the study of cell-cell interactions and tissue-
level responses [22, 25, 26]. When compared to organoids, 
microfluidics offers superior control over spatial organiza-
tion and dynamic microenvironments, allowing for a more 
accurate recapitulation of tissue architecture and function. 
While organoids represent more complex tissue structures, 
they often lack the precise control over cellular interactions 
and environmental cues that microfluidic systems provide

[22, 27, 28]. However, organoids may better mimic certain 
aspects of tissue development and disease progression due 
to their three-dimensional organization and self-assembly 
properties [22, 29].
Microfluidic platforms also offer the possibility of high-
throughput screening and automation, thus accelerating 
drug discovery and development processes. Furthermore, 
microfluidic systems have several advantages over in vivo 
models, including reduced cost, ethical considerations, and 
the ability to perform high-throughput experimentation [4 , 
17, 21, 22, 25, 28]. Nevertheless, they may not fully reca -
pitulate the complexity of the in vivo environment, such as 
systemic interactions, immune responses, and long-term tis-
sue remodeling [4 ].
Microfluidic models utilize channels to recreate the 
complex microarchitecture and fluid dynamics of tissues or 
organs, providing superior control over cellular microenvi-
ronments and enabling precise manipulation of biochemical 
and biophysical cues [18, 20, 22, 26, 30]. While organoids 
and in vivo models provide valuable insights into tissue biol-
ogy and disease mechanisms, microfluidic-based models 
offer a complementary tool for drug screening, disease mod-
eling, and personalized medicine, bridging the gap between 
traditional in vitro and in vivo approaches [16, 30, 31]. In 
this context, Magdalena Flont et al. [32] recently developed 
a new microfluidic system for creating a layered cellular 
cancer model with non-cancerous stroma on a poly(ethylene 
terephthalate) (PET) membrane. Their work aimed to mimic 
the complex structure of a tumor under in vitro conditions, 
focusing on screening anticancer drugs. The microfluidic 
system was designed to enable the modeling of cancer 
diseases in a reproducible and representative manner. By 
utilizing a scaffold made of a porous PET membrane, the 
researchers successfully demonstrated the penetration of test 
compounds into cancer cells through the fibroblast layer and 
pores in the membrane, indicating the system’s potential for 
3D cell culture and testing permeability [32]. In that study, 
the researchers co-cultured cancer cells with non-malignant 
cells on the biocompatible polymer membrane to assess the 
toxicity of anticancer compounds. Using CAM/PI staining 
for each tested drug concentration, the researchers were able 
to evaluate the cytotoxicity and photocytotoxicity of the 
compounds. Additionally, the microfluidic system allowed 
for the analysis of the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy 
in treating melanoma and chemotherapy in treating breast 
cancer [32]. Furthermore, the developed microsystem pro-
vided a more advanced alternative to standard two-dimen-
sional in vitro cell models by enabling cell culture in the 
form of a double monolayer. That arrangement facilitated 
the regular and reproducible organization of cells in the cul -
ture, maintaining intercellular communication essential for 
studying drug screening and diffusion into cancer cells. The 
versatility of the system, coupled with the use of porous membranes, opens up possibilities for testing membrane per -
meability, drug penetration, and developing 3D models of 
various cancer types or non-malignant tissues [32].
Innovations in hot embossing and imprinting, lithogra-
phy, soft lithography, and emerging techniques such as 3D 
printing and laser ablation (Fig.  2) have markedly refined 
the precision of bioink deposition [5 , 33]. These methodolo-
gies can facilitate the fabrication of intricate constructs that 
emulate the cellular milieu with unprecedented fidelity. The 
establishment of microphysiological systems using these 
technologies brings a new era, enabling the recapitulation of 
tissues and organ-specific features on a microscale [33– 35]. 
By employing microfluidics, Chong Shen et al. developed a 
novel lung-on-a-chip platform based on a biomimetic hydro-
gel membrane. That platform aimed to mimic the alveolar 
structure by sandwiching the hydrogel membrane between 
two PDMS parts, with human umbilical vein endothelial 
cells (HUVECs) and human pulmonary alveolar epithelial 
cells (HPAEpiCs) seeded on each side to form the alveolar-
capillary barrier. The microfluidic device allowed for cyclic 
membrane stretching by introducing air into the top chamber 
and fluid flow through the bottom chamber to manipulate 
shear stress on HUVECs and deliver nutrients to HPAEpiCs 
[36]. In the context of drug screening and disease modeling, 
the membrane deformation influenced fluid flow-induced 
shear stress on HUVECs. Computational fluid dynamics 
simulations were used to analyze the peak and mean shear 
stress on the membrane at varying flow rates and strains. The 
flow rate chosen aimed to approximate the shear stress on the 
human capillary wall. The study demonstrated that increas-
ing strain significantly enhanced velocity and shear stress in 
the chamber due to the compacted chamber by the stretched 
hydrogel membrane [36]. Such type of innovative microflu-
idic lung-on-a-chip model provided a platform for studying 
drug sensitivity for individualized treatment of lung cancer 
[36]. Additionally, it offers a valuable tool for modeling pul-
monary fibrosis and understanding the role of alveolar cells 
under mechanical stress in contributing to fibrosis [36].
The described cutting-edge approaches not only enhance 
resolution and control but also lead the way in personalized 
medicine by supporting the study of disease triggers and the 
testing of therapies in precisely tailored environments [37].
 In 2021, Valencia et al. [35] introduced a ground-break -
ing microfluidic system capable of creating multi-layered 
tissues-on-chips. A novel approach to generate 3D multilayer 
tissue models on microfluidic platforms was established 
using a “cut and assemble” method. A parallel flow tech-
nique for bilayer tissue deposition was employed, as well 
as a new vinyl-based microfluidic device, to demonstrate 
the dynamic upkeep of multilayer tissues in conditions that 
simulate the function of blood vessels. Valencia’s prelimi -
nary experiments showed promise (Fig.  4I), demonstrating 
that this biochip improves the development and maintenance 144 In vitro models (2024) 3:139–150
of multilayer tissues, hence increasing the potential for 
novel and improved biological models for complex biologi-
cal interaction research [35]. In 2023, Mohamadali et al. 
[34] developed a cutting-edge skin-on-a-chip microfluidic 
device through soft lithography. A technology that realisti-
cally mimics the entire thickness of human skin (Fig.  4II), 
including the epidermis and dermis layers, was successfully 
created. That model accurately replicated the skin’s vascular 
system with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannels, 
thus enabling efficient nutrition transportation, which is crit-
ical for skin tissue viability and mechanical integrity. The 
tensile strength of the skin sample in the microfluidic device 
decreased by about 30% after 1 week, while the mechanical 
strength for traditional culture platforms decreased to 70% during the same timeframe. Such type of innovation out -
performs traditional culture methods in terms of skin tissue 
health, moisture absorption, structure, gene expression, and 
longevity over at least a week. Its operational simplicity and 
cost-effectiveness render it an invaluable tool for research 
and development, marking a significant leap forward from 
previous methods [34]. Mohamadali’s contribution has 
important implications, offering a more thorough and realis-
tic model of human skin’s physiological processes [34]. This 
skin-on-a-chip model is expected to transform personalized 
medicine by allowing for more precise modeling of complex 
cellular interactions. It has also the potential to revolution-
ize drug discovery and tissue engineering, reducing reliance 
on animal models in favor of more relevant human tissue 
Fig. 2  Main biofabrication techniques employed in the fabrication development of soft microfluidic devices: a highlighting illustration of the 
major methodologies, advantages, and limitations of 3D bioprinting, hot embossing, lithography, and laser ablation techniques145 In vitro models (2024) 3:139–150 
models. The study’s implications span medicine, pharmacol-
ogy, and tissue engineering, underscoring its importance for 
advancing personalized medicine and boosting our under -
standing of tissue biology and disease pathways. To fur -
ther enhance these models, we can adjust essential tunable 
parameters to optimize soft microfluidic systems (Fig.  3). 
These parameters can be meticulously tuned to enhance the 
performance and adaptability of soft microfluidic systems, 
facilitating advancements in biomedical research, chemical 
synthesis, and high-throughput screening applications. The 
combination of these tunable factors provides a versatile 
platform for developing innovative microfluidic solutions.
For example, the selective use of sophisticated materi-
als in bioink formulations is critical to microfluidic plat -
forms’ performance [7 , 38, 39]. These often involve stimuli-
responsive, or “smart” materials, extending the boundaries 
for creating small systems endowed with complex features 
that may enable the development of sophisticated diagnostic 
modalities, and targeted drug delivery systems [7 , 39]. The 
selection of stimuli (e.g., pH, temperature, light) and type of 
biomaterials (e.g., methacrylated gelatin, silk fibroin, poly 
(dimethylacrylamide)) are intricately tied to the final pur -
pose. Hong et al. [40] reported a novel microfluidic technol-
ogy that uses a pH-responsive carbon nanotube (CNT) film 
to efficiently capture and release cancer cells from blood 
samples. That microfluidic device comprised two main 
components: (i) a bottom-layer glass slide coated with a 
CNT film functionalized with pH-responsive poly-L-lysine 
(PLL) connected to anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule 
antibodies and (ii) a top-layer PDMS cover with herringbone 
channels. The setup significantly enhanced cell collision 
with the functionalized CNT film, thus leading to an 86.7% 
capture efficiency. By means of adjusting the pH to trigger 
a conformational shift in the PLL, the device achieved an 
84.7% release efficiency, with the released cells maintain-
ing a high level of biological viability (84.6%). That system, 
schematized in Fig. 4 III, represented a promising approach 
for the capture and release of biologically viable circulating tumor cells (CTC’s) for downstream molecular and func -
tional studies. It successfully demonstrated the strategic use 
of sophisticated materials and stimuli-responsive features 
for microfluidic platforms [40].
The development and application of bioinks in microflu-
idics for applications such as tissue engineering, pharmaco-
logical studies, and organ-on-a-chip frameworks necessitate 
a thorough assessment of their mechanical and biological 
properties [7 , 39]. In a recent study, Mariana Carvalho et al. 
developed a biomimetic and soft lab-on-a-chip platform 
using enzymatically crosslinked silk fibroin (eSF) hydro-
gel for modeling colorectal tumors [41]. That innovation 
aimed to address the limitations of conventional microflu-
idic systems, which rely on solid, non-biodegradable, and 
non-biocompatible materials, by incorporating biological 
components into soft microfluidic systems [41]. The pro-
posed approach holds the promise of revolutionizing in vitro 
cell and tissue culture and modeling using hydrogel-based 
microfluidic technologies. The innovative platform was 
developed using a new methodological approach, employ -
ing eSF hydrogels, known for their unique tunability and 
mechano-chemical capabilities, and ideal structural fidel-
ity [41]. In that study, it was demonstrated that the higher 
the concentration of eSF, the higher the G’, or the stiffness 
(Fig.  4IV). The 14% eSF hydrogel microfluidic platform 
presented a G’ of 7172 ± 605 Pa. The innovative fabrication 
approach has led to the creation of a microfluidic device 
with encapsulated living cells. That device, unlike traditional 
PDMS-based systems that are unsuitable for encapsulating 
cells, can successfully mimic the dynamic 3D microenviron-
ment of colorectal cancer and accurately measure its reac-
tion to chemotherapy agents, and can possibly envisioning 
the creation of vascularized in vitro models. The platform 
showed outstanding structural stability and ability to perfuse 
fluid while showing in vivo-like biological reactions. The 
eSF hydrogel’s stimuli-responsiveness can allow envision-
ing the development of highly customizable in vitro testing 
platforms, with applications ranging from in vitro disease 
Fig. 3  Tunable parameters in

key adjustable parameters are 
categorized into six main areas: 
channel geometry and dimen-
sions, fluid properties, material 
properties, external controls,

147 In vitro models (2024) 3:139–150 
modeling to drug screening, and the broader field of tis-
sue engineering [41]. These bioinks are tailored to allow 
important cellular processes, including nutrition exchange, 
cell viability, proliferation, and adhesion while maintain-
ing compatibility with the microfluidic architecture [43]. 
Moreover, the device design is critical, with current tech -
niques aiming to accurately mimic physiological conditions. 
These devices have flexible conduits and compartments that 
can simulate the complex blood vessel architectures and 
dynamic mechanical stresses that cells encounter in vivo, 
such as shear stress and compression [44]. The incorporation 
of diverse cellular populations and the establishment of gra-
dients for essential components such as nutrients and oxygen 
within these constructs enable a more accurate simulation of 
the cellular microenvironment. Such type of design concept 
goes way beyond standard modeling techniques by shedding 
light on cellular dynamics and interactions in an environ-
ment that closely resembles in vivo conditions. Interestingly, 
Hao Yang et al. developed an innovative microfluidic chip 
that combines dynamic cell culture and dielectrophoretic 
manipulation for the “in situ” assessment of endothelial cell 
mechanics [42]. The device mimics the vascular microen-
vironment and allows for the study of the biomechanical 
effects of fluid shear stress, TNF-α, and blebbistatin on 
HUVECs. That multi-layer microfluidic device was created 
using PDMS casting and oxygen plasma bonding, enabling precise control of cell culture conditions and mechanical 
measuring operations (Fig.  4V). The main results revealed 
that increased fluid shear stress enhances Young’s modulus 
of HUVECs, thus indicating the importance of hemodynam-
ics in cellular biomechanics, whereas TNF-α and blebbista-
tin significantly reduce HUVECs stiffness [42]. The research 
contribution introduced a novel vascular-mimetic dynamic 
culture system and monitoring approach, significantly 
improving the study’s efficiency and accuracy on hemody -
namics and pharmacological mechanisms. The microfluidic 
chip’s ability to respond to changes in the environmental 
conditions presents an invaluable tool for cardiovascular dis-
ease research, for example, offering significant advantages 
in simulating in vivo conditions, high throughput analysis, 
and potential applications in drug screening and disease 
modeling [42].
Challenges and future directions
Soft microfluidic systems have unequivocally revolution-
ized the landscape of disease modeling, allowing for subtle 
and customized investigations that were previously out of 
reach. These models provide unprecedented opportunities 
for studying disease ontogeny and therapeutic approaches 
within a controlled and reproducible setting. Nevertheless, 
challenges still remain in the advancement of biofabrica-
tion and soft microfluidic systems, despite the strides made 
in diagnostics and disease modeling. A critical obstacle is 
related to the need to replicate complex tissue structures 
and achieve functional vascularization within microfluidic 
devices. Such type of grand challenge calls for significant 
inventive approaches and designs for emulating the sophis-
ticated architecture and functionalities of living systems 
in vitro. The refinement of endothelial cell incorporation to 
mimic in vivo vasculature [11] represents a stride towards 
this goal. Moreover, the assessment of neuro-epithelial con-
tacts within co-cultures, aimed at unraveling the complexi-
ties of gastrointestinal diseases [ 12], underscores the need 
for enhanced biological mimicry.
Additionally, ensuring the scalability and reproducibil-
ity of these systems for widespread application in diag -
nostics and disease modeling is of paramount importance. 
Addressing these technical challenges is imperative to 
unlock the full potential of soft microfluidics, ultimately 
enabling more effective tailored cost-effective and per -
sonalized solutions for healthcare. In vitro testing is vital 
for validating microfluidic chips [21, 24, 32, 36]. This 
includes assessing fluid dynamics and mixing efficiency 
to ensure accurate replication of physiological fluid flows 
[45, 46]. In vitro cytotoxicity screening and live/dead cell 
staining can help assessing that materials are non-toxic to 
cells. Simulating biological conditions, such as controlled Fig. 4   Image panel with different microfluidic devices: I visualiza-

temperature and pH, best emulates human physiological 
settings for accurate biological interaction testing [45– 48]. 
By means of applying such types of methods, research-
ers ensure that new devices are precise, reliable, and 
biocompatible, demonstrating improvements over exist-
ing technologies and advancing personalized healthcare 
solutions in diagnostics and disease modeling. Advance-
ments in biosensor platforms are also anticipated, aiming 
for broader clinical applications including comprehensive 
disease diagnostics, therapeutics, and potentially real-time 
biomolecular interaction monitoring in point-of-care set-
tings [49].
Looking ahead, the future of biofabrication and soft 
microfluidic systems holds great innovation potential. As 
research progresses, a key focus will be refining system 
precision and functionality, ensuring that they not only 
mimic but also replicate the dynamic mechanical proper -
ties of living tissues more closely. A particular area of 
interest lies in the versatility of these systems to encapsu -
late a variety of cell types fostering the creation of more 
intricate and mimetic cellular arrangements and microen-
vironments. Future research aims to refine the precision 
and functionality of these systems as there is a marked 
interest in integrating more complex cellular and micro-
bial components to faithfully replicate organ physiology, 
particularly within the gastrointestinal tract for extensive 
pharmacokinetic analysis [50].
The integration of Clustered Regularly Interspaced 
Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) within microflu-
idic devices is another promising venture. Such type of 
synergistic approach could yield unprecedented advance-
ments in the field. By means of combining the unparalleled 
specificity of CRISPR technologies with the versatility and 
efficiency of microfluidic systems, scientists are on the 
edge of developing highly targeted therapies for genetic 
disorders, enabling the correction of mutations at their 
source with minimal off-target effects [51, 52]. Further -
more, this integration paves the way for high-throughput 
screening of genetic interactions and drug responses in 
real-time, offering insights into complex biological pro-
cesses at an unparalleled scale. The ability to manipulate 
genes within microenvironments that closely mimic the 
physiological conditions of living tissues could revolution-
ize our approach to understanding disease mechanisms, 
leading to the development of novel treatments and diag-
nostics [51, 52].
Addressing these challenges and harnessing the innova-
tion potential of biomaterials, biofabrication methods and 
soft microfluidic systems will be instrumental in decoding 
complex biological interactions and pathologies, contribut-
ing significantly to the evolution of personalized medicine 
and revolutionizing the landscape of disease modeling and 
treatment.Conclusion
The field of biofabrication has undergone remarkable strides 
in recent years, marking a transformative era  in diagnos-
tics and disease modeling propelled by the advent of soft 
microfluidic systems. Innovations in fabrication techniques 
such as 3D printing, soft lithography, and laser ablation 
have facilitated the creation of intricate, three-dimensional 
in vitro models that can better emulate human tissues and 
organs with unprecedented fidelity. These advancements 
not only enhance disease modeling accuracy but also lay 
the foundation for personalized medicine, offering tailored 
therapeutic strategies based on individual physiological 
responses. The groundbreaking work of several researchers 
and pioneers underscores the transformative potential of soft 
microfluidic systems in creating multi-layered tissue mod-
els and skin-on-a-chip devices, enabling in-depth studies of 
complex biological interactions and drug responses within 
controlled microenvironments. Moreover, the strategic use 
of advanced soft biomaterials and stimuli-responsive bioinks 
can open up new avenues for the development of sophisti-
cated diagnostic tools and targeted drug delivery systems. 
As biofabricated microfluidic systems expand into clinical 
settings, they present an exciting frontier for personalized 
diagnostics, patient-specific treatment planning and stratifi-
cation, and even the fabrication of bespoke tissue implants 
for regenerative medicine. The journey from conceptual 
frameworks to practical applications epitomizes interdisci-
plinary collaboration, drawing upon expertise from materials 
science, biology, engineering, and computer science. With 
continued innovation, these systems promise to revolution-
ize medical approaches, profoundly impacting healthcare 
outcomes worldwide.
