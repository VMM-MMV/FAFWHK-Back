Abstract
Additive manufacturing allows the production of complex and custom designs including lattice structures—porous metallic 
structures with designed porosity and tailored mechanical properties. The bulk material has a key influence on the eventual 
properties of the porous lattice structure material. Among metallic biomaterials, beta-titanium alloys are gaining increasing 
interested because of their low Young’s modulus. In this work, the heat treatment of beta-Ti21S alloy is investigated in the 
context of octet truss lattice structures. The intention is to improve the performance of these structures for their reliable use 
in biomedical applications such as for bone implants. The study makes use of laser powder bed fusion of representative sam-
ples, uses microCT for physical characterization of manufacturing quality, while quasi-static and fatigue testing is performed 
to evaluate the performance of these lattice structures. The results indicate that the heat treatment significantly improves 
the fatigue properties of the lattice structures while changing the quasi-static failure mode more towards a stretch-based 
failure mode. These findings have practical implications for the implementation of this material and structure combination 
in medical implants. By enhancing the performance of the lattice structures, the study paves the way for their reliable use 
in biomedical applications.

1 Introduction
The study of metallic lattice materials has gained popular -
ity in recent decades due to advancements in form-freedom 
fabrication techniques [1 ]. These techniques have improved 
the ability to control the size and shape of lattice materials, 
making them highly useful in biomedical applications [2 ]. The most commonly used method for fabrication of bio-
medical components is metal additive manufacturing, spe-
cifically the powder bed fusion process [3 ]. In this process, 
thermal energy from an electron or laser source is used to 
melt a powder bed and create the desired shape. Laser-based 
powder bed fusion of metals (PBF-LB/M) provides better 
surface roughness and more precise geometry than electron-
based powder bed fusion (PBF-EB/M) [ 4]. As a result, PBF-
LB/M is better suited for fabricating complex and intricate 
biomedical components with fine features and high quality.
Despite its ability to fabricate feature sizes as small as 
0.1 mm in complex geometries, the properties of final geom-
etries produced using PBF-LB/M are still a concern for load-
bearing applications. This issue has been studied in the con-
text of defect tolerant lattice structures made of beta-Ti 21S 
alloy [5 ]. In Ref. [5 ], it was found that micro-notches present 
in the rough surface, or highly localized stress raiser loca-
tions, on the surface of the lattice were the primary cause of 
premature failure and reduced mechanical properties. The 
negative impact of these micro-notches was greater when 
the cell size was less than 4 mm, or when the strut thickness 
was below 0.64 mm. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the  * M. Benedetti

manufacturability of simple geometries in various cell sizes 
before attempting to fabricate complicated geometries.
Present beta-Ti21S alloy exhibits remarkable mechani-
cal properties already in the as-built state with a low elastic 
modulus required for biomedical application [6 ]. Neverthe-
less, the rapid heating and solidification rate during PBF-
LB promote the structural and microstructural anisotropy 
inside the material, formation of microsegregation and 
presence of residual stress deleterious for the mechanical 
and stability response of the part. A lot of studies consider 
the effect of different heat treatments on the most common 
Ti alloy used in the biomedical field, namely Ti–6Al–4V 
[7–11]. Seyed Alireza Etsami et al. demonstrated that the 
Ti–6Al–4V heat treated below β  transus temperature  (Tβ) 
is characterized by increased ductility due to the formation 
of α + β lamellar structure [ 7]. Zhiyi Zou et al., proposed 
new heat treatments based on the refinement of the prior-β 
grains thanks to rapid heat treatments in the β  phase field 
leading to increased strength without loss in ductility [10]. 
A dual stage heat treatment was proposed by Jinlong Su 
et al. to obtain a strengthened bimodal microstructure [11]. 
The effect of heat treatment on Ti–6Al–7Nb, a non-cytotoxic 
vanadium-free alloy, in comparison with Ti–6Al–4V was 
investigated by Chao Xu et al. The authors demonstrated that 
a solution treatment above the β  transus permits to meet the 
biomedical standards [12]. In the last years, metastable β -Ti 
alloys produced by additive manufacturing gained increasing 
interest respect to the conventionally forged alloys. Proper 
post-heat treatments were studied to improve both, micro-
structure and properties [13– 17]. In case of metastable β Ti 
alloys, a solubilization at a temperature below  Tβ ensured 
optimal combination of fine β  grain and sufficient β  dissolu-
tion. The aging treatment at temperature between 500 and 
700 °C after solubilization led to the precipitation of α  phase 
with a morphology depending on the aging temperature. The 
mechanical properties could be tuned accordingly [13 ]. Con -
sidering the metastable β  Ti21S, excellent results in terms 
of strength–ductility ratio were achieved by heat treating the 
wrought alloy [18, 19]. To the authors best knowledge, just 
a few papers report about the influence of heat treatment on 
microstructure and properties of Ti21S produced by PBF 
[20], none of them dealing with lattice structures. Inves-
tigations are needed to exploit the use of the heat-treated 
alloy for cellular structures, e.g., for lightweight design or 
biomedical applications.
The current work focuses on the octet truss topology, 
whose cell size of 4 mm was selected based on manufactur -
ability assessments done in Ref. [5 ]. The octet truss topology 
has some advantages over other topologies in the biomedical 
field: (i) it has two types of different pore sizes enabling bet-
ter osseointegration, leading to better biocompatibility. The 
small pore size contributes toward better initial cell seeding 
by providing surface availability for cell attachment in which low permeability is required while the big pore size enables 
nutrients to flow easily through the structure in which good 
permeability is required [21]; (ii) the octet truss topology 
itself provides the isotropic material properties because it 
has symmetric design. It has been reported that material 
properties of lattices depend on the loading direction [22], 
assuming the same fabrication quality achieved. Moreover, 
the octet truss is less sensitive to the building direction if 
the comparison is made to the other topological design 
[1], mainly because the building direction in AM should 
be strictly selected in the way that the downward faces are 
avoided.
The octet truss topology belongs to the strut-based archi -
tecture category, which is the most widely used category 
in various applications. The deformation behavior of strut-
based lattices can be described based on the Maxwell sta-
bility criterion [23]. This discriminates the lattice behavior 
according to the sign of the coefficient M  = b − 3j + 6, where 
b is the number of struts and j is the number of nodes. Under 
compression loading, strut-based lattices can collapse in 
two ways: (i) through rotation of the struts about the joint 
if M < 0 (bending-dominated mechanism), or (ii) through 
axial tensile and compression loading of the struts if M  ≥ 0 
(stretching-dominated mechanism). The octet truss topol-
ogy theoretically follows the stretching-dominated mecha-
nism where M  = 0, resulting in higher weight efficiency and 
modulus compared to bending-dominated materials [24, 25]. 
However, these models do not consider the influence of con-
stitutive material properties, such as microstructural prop-
erties (i.e., internal defects, grain morphology, and phases) 
and intrinsic mechanical properties (elastic modulus, yield 
stress, and ductility), on the deformation behavior of lattices.
The influence of microstructure on the mechanical 
behavior of additively manufactured lattices has been limit-
edly studied [26, 27]. Babamiri et al. [26] investigated the 
relationship between the manufacturing variables, such as 
post-processing heat treatment, and the quasi-static and 
dynamic behavior of various lattice topologies made of duc-
tile Inconel 718 material, including the octet truss topology. 
The heat treatment affected the microstructure of the lattice 
material, wherein the improved grain morphology led to an 
increase in flow stress by 25% in a 4 mm unit cell size with a 
0.689 mm strut diameter. Another study by Duport et al. [27] 
explored the impact of microstructure optimization on the 
mechanical behavior of a binary beta-Ti-14Mo octet truss 
lattice fabricated by PBF-EB. The mechanical behavior of 
three different microstructures (α  + β; metastable β ; and 
β + ωiso) were compared. The as-built α  + β microstructure 
showed unstable post-yielding behavior under compression 
loading, while the heat-treated microstructure ( β + ωiso) had 
increased tolerance to plastic buckling and stabilized post-
yielding behavior, making it suitable for energy absorption 
applications. The precipitation of ω  phase is detrimental to 949 Progress in Additive Manufacturing (2024) 9:947–957

ductility of Ti21S, so that this alloy is typically aged in the 
alpha phase temperature field to obtain a precipitation-hard-
ened β microstructure, whose strength is mostly controlled 
by the volume fraction and morphology of α  precipitates. A 
fine intragranular precipitation of α  has been recommended 
to achieve the best strength to density ratio [28, 29]. These 
studies highlight the significance of material properties 
on the mechanics of lattices. However, further research is 
needed to fully understand the impact on all materials and 
lattice configurations.
The X-ray microcomputed tomography scan (microCT) 
is one of the main tools used to study lattice materials 
[30]. It has become an established and effective method in 
the additive manufacturing (AM) lattice field for not only 
dimensional measurement, but also for investigating fail-
ure mechanisms, due to its accuracy and ability to capture 
and highlight crucial sites in 3D. This makes the microCT 
technique superior to traditional 2D characterization meth-
ods like microscopic investigation. As a result, this method 
has gained popularity in recent years for investigating AM 
lattice structures. For example, Kolken et al. [31] used the 
microCT method to study the morphological properties and 
fatigue failure mechanism of an auxetic Ti–6Al–4V lattice, 
while also using digital image correlation (DIC) in 2D to 
study the fatigue failure mechanism. While the DIC method 
provides online data, it has a limitation in data analysis at 
high fatigue frequencies. The microCT method, on the other 
hand, provides 3D observations of samples without the need 
for a flat 2D section.
This study aims to evaluate the potential of Ti21S octet 
truss lattices for biomedical applications. To this end, the 
octet truss topology has been optimized for better manufac-
turability and reduced elastic modulus. Cubic lattices were 
manufactured using a PBF-LB process, and their morpho-
logical properties were studied using microCT. The impact 
of heat treatment, in particular of direct aging at 590 °C, 
on the mechanical properties of the constitutive material 
was also analyzed. Finally, the static and fatigue mechani-
cal properties of the lattices were evaluated, and the fail-
ure mechanisms were explored using CT data from failed 
fatigue-tested samples.
2  Experimental materials and methods
The experimentation was carried out on specimens addi-
tively manufactured via laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF) 
using a pre-alloyed β-Ti21S powder produced by plasma 
atomization (GKN Hoeganaes Corporation, Cinnaminson, 
NJ, USA). For this purpose, an L-PBF machine model MYS-
INT100 (SISMA, Piovene Rocchete, VI, Italy) with a laser 
spot of 55 μm was employed. The machine is equipped with 
a building platform of 100 mm diameter and a 200 W fiber laser. An XY alternate scan strategy was adopted along with 
a powder layer thickness of 20 μm. Some of the specimens 
were subjected to a post-processing heat treatment. This was 
carried out in TAV furnace and prior to all heating stages, 
chamber was subjected to vacuum 5  ×  10–4 mbar followed 
by argon backfilling to prevent oxidation. The heat treatment 
strategy aimed at avoiding the precipitation of undesired 
brittle ω phase (see [20] for further information) and was 
performed according to the ASTM B265 standard [32]: the 
samples were heat treated at 590 °C with a heating rate of 10 
°C/min, a dwell time of 8 h, and a cooling rate of 30 °C/min.
To characterize the quasi-static tensile properties, cylin-
drical bars were printed along the longitudinal axis. From 
these bars, dog-bone specimens (with 5 mm gage diameter) 
were machined and tested using a servo-hydraulic universal 
testing machine INSTRON 8516 (Instron, Nordwood, MA, 
USA), equipped with hydraulic grips, a load cell of 100 kN 
(non-linearity ± 0.1% of R.O.) and an axial extensometer 
(12.5 mm gage length, non-linearity ± 0.15% of R. O.). The 
yield strength was determined as the 0.2% offset yield stress.
The focus of the experimentation was on cubic lattice 
specimens. A careful reader may object that the impact of 
post-heat treatment could have been explored on conven-
tional bulk tensile specimens as well. However, it should be 
noted that lattice specimens have distinct stress conditions, 
with localized stress peaks at the nodes that are absent in 
bulk coupons. During high-cycle fatigue tests, the stress 
state of bulk coupons remains in the elastic regime. As a 
result, the effect of strain softening on the fatigue strength, 
which is expected in lattice components, cannot be observed 
in the latter case.
The lattice coupons were made up of a 6 × 6 × 6 arrange-
ment of octet truss unit cells as depicted in Fig. 1 . The unit 
cell size was set to 4 mm, based on the manufacturing feasi-
bility established in Ref. [5 ]. Using the NTopology software 
(NTop, New York, NY, USA), the nodes of each unit cell 
were filleted to reduce stress concentration in these critical 
fatigue locations. Porosity, strut size, and fillet radius were 
optimized to achieve a homogenized Young’s modulus of 
approximately 3.5 GPa, making these structures potentially 
suitable for use in prosthetic implants. The optimal values 
are listed in Table  1. It is worth mentioning that the strut 
thickness of 0.63 mm is very close to the value found in Ref. 
[5] and has been shown to provide good manufacturability 
and excellent static mechanical properties.
A total of 24 lattice coupons were fabricated, with half 
of them undergoing heat treatment. The lattice specimens 
underwent both quasi-static and cyclic mechanical testing. 
The quasi-static tests were performed using the aforemen-
tioned servo-hydraulic testing machine with compression 
plates, in accordance with standard ISO 13314:2011 [33]. 
The tests were conducted at room temperature with a con-
stant actuator speed of 0.5 mm/min, and a linear variable 950 Progress in Additive Manufacturing (2024) 9:947–957

displacement transducer (LVDT) was used to measure 
the displacement up to 15% elongation. The resulting 
stress–strain curve was used to calculate the monotonic 
Young’s modulus (Em), 0.2% offset yield strength (σy), 
and maximum compressive strength (σmc). The cyclic tests 
were done to obtain the cyclic Young’s modulus (Ec) after 
the stress–strain response stabilized. The specimens were 
loaded between 20 and 70% of the yield load obtained from the monotonic testing using a triangular wave shape 
for five cycles. High-cycle compression–compression 
fatigue testing was performed using a Rumul Testronic 
(Russenberger Prüfmaschinen, Neuhausen am Rheinfall, 
Switzerland) resonant fatigue test machine equipped with 
a 50 kN load cell with a load ratio R of 0.1 in compression. 
Fatigue tests were run in laboratory environment at various 
stress amplitudes to evaluate fatigue lives ranging from Fig. 1  a Definition of unit cell

1 ×  105 to 1 ×  107 cycles. Each S –N curve was determined 
using around 12 specimens; run-out tests were stopped at 
1 ×  107 cycles when no fracture occurred. Specimens were 
regarded as failed if they underwent a drop in stiffness 
larger than 10%.
Each S–N curve included at least one run-out test and 
was interpolated using an asymptotic equation to accu-
rately depict the knee shape of the experimental S –N data:
where σmax is the maximum homogenized stress and Nf the 
number of cycles to failure. The scatter of the experimental 
data was determined by assessing the estimated regression 
variance, considered to be non-varying in the whole inves-
tigated fatigue range, and defined as
where /u1D70Emax ,i are the i-th fatigue data point, /uni0302.s1/u1D70Emax ,i are their 
estimators, n is the number of experimental data points and 
p is the number of parameters in the regression (3 in the 
present case).
MicroCT scans were performed using a Nanotom S sys-
tem (General Electric, Niskayuna, NY, USA), and analysis 
performed in Dragonfly software (Object Research Sys-
tems, Inc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Local wall thick -
ness was evaluated using the mesh thickness function, and 
cracks were identified in cross-sectional images and 3D 
rendering used to visualize these locations.(1) /u1D70Emax=C1+C2

3.1  Microstructure and bulk mechanical properties
The microstructure of the alloy as-built reveals evidence of 
rapid solidification during L-PBF. Specifically, the melt pool 
boundaries and an extremely fine cellular structure are vis-
ible (see Fig.  2a). The high cooling rate facilitated the forma-
tion of a fully beta-metastable structure without any second-
ary precipitates. A detailed account of the microstructure of 
the as-built alloy is presented in Ref. [6 ]. The solidification 
microstructure is still discernible in the heat-treated sample 
(Fig.  2b), with evidence of the original columnar grains and 
melting pools. Although most α precipitates are intragranu-
lar, some small α grain boundary colonies are visible upon 
closer inspection, as indicated by SEM micrographs. The 
alpha lamellae, which are smaller than 1 μm, grow from 
the grain boundary towards the center of the grain (αWBG). 
Alternatively, they can nucleate inside the grain, forming 
a knitted/beam arrangement (αWM), with certain preferred 
orientations that are related to the growth direction and the 
parent β-structure. Despite the visibility of the melting pool 
boundaries, they do not appear to have an impact on the 
precipitation of α.
The monotonic tensile properties of the β-Ti21S alloy 
in both as-built and heat-treated conditions are compared 
in Table  2 with the minimum values prescribed by ASTM 
F2924-14 for the golden standard biomedical Ti-grade 23 
(Ti–6Al–4V ELI). In Fig.  3, the monotonic stress–strain 
curves are plotted. It can be noted that the β-Ti21S alloy 
is compliant with the ASTM F2924-14 [34] prescription 
only in the heat-treated state. In addition, this post-process

treatment permits to eliminate the strain softening displayed 
by the as-built condition and typical of many metastable β-Ti 
alloys [35, 36].
3.2  Metrological analyses of lattices
MicroCT analysis of the local wall thickness reveals, as 
expected, some increased thickness in the joints, indicat-
ing > 1 mm in these regions while the struts have a thickness 
of 0.5 mm. This can be seen in Fig.  4a, b, while (c) shows 
a cross-sectional image of the actual sample compared to 
the design. This latter comparison shows good build quality 
with some excess material in the down-skin regions only. 
Detailed information extracted from these 3D analyses are 
included in Table  3. The comparison of the same 3D infor -
mation from design file allows simple evaluation, showing 
that the lattice is manufactured very close to the expected 
parameters.
3.3  Mechanical properties of lattices
Representative monotonic stress–strain curves are compared 
in Fig.  5 and Table  4. It can be observed that despite being 
nominally categorized as stretch-dominated, the specimen 
in its as-built condition exhibits a gradual transition to a 
long flat stress plateau. This can be attributed to the strain 
softening localized at the nodes which behave as plastic 
hinges making the global response of the structure bending-
dominated after yielding. The high strain energy absorbed 
before final failure indicates the potential use of lattices in 
as-built conditions for energy absorbing applications. Sup-
pressing the strain softening through heat treatment leads to 
a pure stretch-dominated behavior. This is characterized by a sudden, post-yielding collapse at stress levels much higher 
than the plateau observed in the as-built condition at the cost 
of a very limited strain to failure.
The results of compression–compression high-cycle 
fatigue tests are plotted in Fig.  6a, b in terms of homog-
enized maximum axial stress σmax and normalized stress

to the compressive yield strength σy, respectively. Best-fit 
coefficients C1, C2, m of Eq.  1 and standard deviation S  are 
provided in the legend of Fig.  6. It can be noted that the heat 
treatment considerably improves the fatigue strength, not 
only in terms of absolute but also relative axial stress. In 
particular, the HCF strength at 1 ×  107 cycles is increased 
by almost 120%. Suppressing strain softening appears to be 
effective in improving the fatigue strength of lattice struc-
tures. This can be attributed to the fact that the high stress 
concentration in the nodes of lattice specimens leads to 
localized plasticization, which expands with each cycle dur -
ing the fatigue tests of as-built specimens due to the strain 
softening. As depicted in Fig.  7, this unfavorable outcome 
not only reduces the fatigue strength, but also results in a 
noticeable and premature reduction in the stiffness of the 
as-built samples during fatigue tests. These results indicate that lattice specimens under variable loads should undergo 
heat treatment prior to use. The heat treatment enhances the 
normalized high-cycle fatigue strength to above 0.25, which 
can be considered a remarkable achievement compared to 
the fatigue strength data published in the literature [1 ].
The CT scans and SEM inspections of fatigued samples 
are depicted in Figs.  8 and 9 , respectively. It can be observed 
that the as-built specimens exhibit diffused fatigue damage 
in the form of cracks that have formed at multiple locations Table 3  The morphological properties of optimized octet truss lattice structure

in both the struts and nodes (Figs.  8a, 9a). This behavior 
is similar to that seen in cubic lattices tested in Ref. [5 ]. 
Surface imperfections, acting as stress concentrators, serve 
as preferential crack initiation sites (Fig.  9c). In contrast, 
fatigue failure in heat-treated lattices is confined to the fillet 
roots at the nodes only (Figs.  8b, 9b). The suppression of 
the strain softening mechanism seems to have eliminated the 
impact of the micro-notches on the strut surface (Fig.  9d).
4  Conclusions
The mechanical performance of Ti21S alloy octet truss lat-
tice structure fabricated by laser powder bed fusion has been 
evaluated in the as-built state as well as after direct ageing 
at 590 °C for 8 h. The following main results were obtained:
• The as-built bulk alloy is characterized by a beta-met-
astable cellular microstructure showing good mechani-
cal strength-ductility combination, and a marked strain 
softening. The heat treatment causes a fine precipitation 
of intragranular α and promotes a remarkable increase in

softening exhibited by the base material in this microstructural condi-
tion

strength and elastic modulus with no change in fracture 
elongation, and further eliminates strain softening.
• MicroCT scans were used for detailed characterization 
of the structure indicating good build quality lacking 
defects. Post-fatigue samples were used to visualize the 
crack locations in 3D showing all cracks occur on struts 
and near nodes but not through nodes.
• The monotonic stress compression tests on the lattice 
structures evidence that suppressing the strain soften-
ing through heat treatment leads from the pure bending-
dominated behavior of as-built sample to a pure stretch-
dominated behavior.
• The heat treatment considerably improves the compres -
sion–compression fatigue strength of lattice structure 
(by almost 120%), confirming that suppressing strain 
softening is more effective in improving the fatigue 
strength of lattice structures compared to bulk speci-
mens. This could be ascribed to the reduced localized 
plasticization in the nodes of lattice specimens. The diffused fatigue damage observed in as-built lattice in 
the form of multiple cracks in both the struts and nodes 
is limited to the nodes fillet roots in heat-treated lat-
tices.
Future work will focus on evaluating the influence of heat 
treatment on the fatigue strength of various cell topologies 
(i.e., bending-dominated and triply periodic minimal sur -
face), investigating their behavior also under high-temper -
ature conditions.
